        "content": "A few days ago I followed the directions given and ended up in a very dangerous situation on the side of a mountain. I was pulling a large fifth wheel trailer and the maps led us onto a road that would have required us to back up for 2-3 miles to get out. So, we pressed forward following the map up the mountain and all of a sudden we came to a switchback or hairpin turn in the road without any warning. Since there wasn't any way of turning around and no chance of backing up we pressed on. Then again without warning we came to another switchback in the road. By this time the grade on the road was greater than 6%; I estimated between 6 and 8%. This time trying to get around the corner required us put our lives and property at risk. We had to pile stones etc. in the ditch for the trailer tires to drive on and drove the truck way out within inches of the edge of the cliff to get around. The camper cleared the wall by about 3 inches. We ended up damaging the truck and camper making that turn! If we had been alerted to the kind of road we were going travel on we would have selected another route. Google Maps needs to either advise about roads like that before routing anyone down them or create a setting that allows for the vehicle type (trailers, campers, motor homes) and route them onto roads safe for travel. I hope Google does something about this before someone is injured or killed."

Don't get me wrong, the 3D flyover feature on Apple maps is nice to just browse around and kill some time, but if you want a proper navigation app with accurate and up to date business listings being the maps are constantly updated by users, this is hands down my all time favorite navigation app.  Sure, Waze may have some useful features, but isn't always accurate with traffic conditions being those are updated by users, while googles traffic service uses your GPS data and uses your speed and  the speed from other users around you to give you a pretty accurate speed and traffic function on Google Maps.  Sure some may think that google using your GPS data is like spying on you, but they only use that bit of GPS data is to give up to date traffic conditions. It's not tracking where you walk or shop or get directions too, it just uses GPS data coming from your phone when moving at more than a brisk walking pace, so above 10+ MPH it's using your GPS Data for traffic.  I love Google Maps, just wish they had a 3D setting like Apple maps does and like how Google earth has it, but they should incorporate that 3D city/building modeling abilities into standard Google Maps."

Here's what I wish the app for iPhone did/would do better:\n-Quick button access to drive home or work. I used the Google travel times widget and think that is incredibly helpful, but I think it could also be integrated into the app itself. Alternatively, I don't actually need to know how long it will take me to get to work, I just like the shortcut to open the app and navigate me home. Would it save battery life (and data) to offer a widget that just serves as shortcuts without travel times?\n-My neighborhood and city is covered by wifi. I like that my phone automatically connects securely to Xfinity wifi, but it leaves my Google maps confused and unable to provide a route. I'm not sure if this is a bug, but the best solution I've found is to turn off wifi while searching for routes, then remember to turn wifi back on when I reach my destination.\n-I'd like to be able to scroll through traffic at different times during a day on the app (like you can online). It is annoying when I search the distance/travel time to a place but realize the app is showing rush hour/real time that will not apply to when I want to start my drive on Saturday AM."

(I wish the iPhone would allow me to choose the map of my choice but that's another issue) lately however I've noticed that Google maps will navigate me onto the express lanes (Toll roads) that run parallel to the highways even when there is not any additional traffic on the main highways. The App will show me options to take other routes, but it will not offer me the option to take the parallel non-toll road.  Why is the app adamant about forcing me onto toll roads?  Are you getting kickbacks?"

I have to tap the screen again, hoping the screen doesn't lock, to get phone back and go back to car sharing app. If I'm on a street where it's tough to find the address, I need the map to stay active. I use the satellite feature so use the buildings outline and address to make sure I'm in the best place. The alley bug seems to be improved.

This is super helpful when you don't know an area, lose perfect signal for half a second in downtown, then just follow the guidance out. By the time you're to the highway, the faster, non-toll route is now behind you bad would take much longer. I've paid closer attention and this is something that happens regularly. It doesn't happen every time the app tries to reroute for no reason, but just make sure to check your route after it does. \n\nBecause this app seems to get off on making you take tolls. The 'remember settings' button won't remember to avoid tolls. Worse, even if YOU remember, there's a chance the app will reroute through tolls without your consent."

I have to back out of that function at least two steps in hopes that you'll sometimes give me the option to manually tap on the little \"go\" button or the little triangle to finally get directions. Waze integrates perfectly with Lyft but I don't feel safe using Waze because it lacks lane assist technology. It's too unsafe to spend all my time and energy taking my eyes of the road just to fight with a navigation app in hopes to make it work for me before my passenger cancels on me. You're supposed to be the best navigation app out there. You would be my go to app. Half the time I have to close Google Maps and restart it just to get it to work with Lyft while in traffic. The auto navigate function including route pickup/drop off/stop changes and auto cancel route functions along with a button for easy switching between Google Maps and the rideshare driver's app should work just as it does with Waze. Update: This version apparently gives me weird notifications sometimes even when the app is closed. It's not constant, but it has happened a few times and somehow is working against my Uber Driver notifications while getting trip requests."

Here are a few ideas: \"Discover gas stations / pharmacies / car dealerships / train stations / police stations / post offices / grocery stores / etc around this area.\" Position all these labels neatly floating over and across the map, so that the actual usable map area will be reduced to about one square inch on a 9.7 inch iPad.

Although I am on the larger side it is a bit presumptious of the google people to think I always want to drink or eat! Another annoyance is that it that when I save a location it shows me all the details of that location; address, phone number, website, and photo, I don't need all this info, just list saved locations with the name I give them, I can figure out the rest! Google maps route selection is often not the best but the street view is still its best feature, apart from that the app works alright but there is plenty of room for improvement. There is still an obvious pathetic rivalry between google and apple that cripples both their mapping apps to the detrement of the user."

        "content": "First off I live in Phoenix so my review is based mostly off of my usage there. However I was a flight attendant for some time and used maps in just about every US State, Canada, Mexico, Italy, and England, and Scotland and it will remain my #1 choice for navigation software.  I've been using Google Maps since Google decided to start mapping! It was a godsend when things like MapQuest were the only services available and has only gotten better over time. I love how seamlessly it integrates with websites, apps, programs, and software across a number of different industries. It is available on every platform which I know to be in existence and is useful for just about any purpose, whether it's looking up an address, locating a business, acquiring directions, determining route times by method of transportation (in my city it even offers Uber or Lyft rates), sharing information, researching the surrounding area of a location using street view, or simply checking out the terrain for a hike or a bike ride. They do it all, they do it accurately and effectively. But most importantly they do it safely (i.e. there is no option to take your eyes off the road to let fellow drivers know there is a cop monitoring your speed)."

Or maybe just have the app remind the driver of the limit each time it makes an announcement on directions. It is great Google maps shows on the listed directions where the toll booth would be... I would love for it to tell me how much the toll is!! Lol I visited a few family members in NYC and NJ recently and it seems every major expressway has a toll!!

The only and only problem I have is the \"Second Turn Notification\". \nGuys! the way google map performs when you exit the freeways with immediate turns (north, south, west or east) is extremely confusing. \nLet's use 405 North exiting Wiltshire blvd as an example. \nThe map asks you to exit Wiltshire Blvd but there's no way to find out if you need to take east or west. \nThose 2 are immediate turns after you exit the freeway so the highlighted rout will change when you exit the freeway in \"2\"! Seconds after you need to decide to take either West or East. \n\nSolution: please work on the second turn notification carefully. The map needs to indicate the next exit clearly in advance. \n\nThe highlighted rout is useless in many cases. Get rid of that and show only where you need to go exactly. The highlighted rout sometimes appears only a few seconds before the driver needs to make a decision on turns. \nPlease fix that issue."

I even deleted the not so good Apple Maps from my phone cause I thought I won't ever need it. Not anymore. \nThe problems started few months ago. First problem: when I get directions and I try to zoom in to see something, it always zooms out by itself and that is very annoying. I have to stop the directions if I want to zoom. Second problem (and the most important for me as a semi truck driver) is the satellite images. It started loading them very slowly and now It doesn't even load them at all. So now the app is pretty much useless for me. As a truck driver I always need to check the places where I pick up and deliver loads so I don't stuck somewhere. I need to see how the parking lots and streets look like, where the entrances and driveways are and stuff like that. \nI don't know if it's s just my phone that causing those problems but it doesn't make sense to me cause I don't have any problems with other apps that are using Google Maps. And also my IPhone 6S Plus works flawlessly!"

I have to back out of that function at least two steps in hopes that you'll sometimes give me the option to manually tap on the little \"go\" button or the little triangle to finally get directions. Waze integrates perfectly with Lyft but I don't feel safe using Waze because it lacks lane assist technology. It's too unsafe to spend all my time and energy taking my eyes of the road just to fight with a navigation app in hopes to make it work for me before my passenger cancels on me. You're supposed to be the best navigation app out there. You would be my go to app. Half the time I have to close Google Maps and restart it just to get it to work with Lyft while in traffic. The auto navigate function including route pickup/drop off/stop changes and auto cancel route functions along with a button for easy switching between Google Maps and the rideshare driver's app should work just as it does with Waze."

I have had multiple problems in the last week with very odd behavior including my home location suddenly shifting a mile down the road, very bizzare routing (trying to send me on a 45 minute route for a 10 minute trip) and a complete flake-out where the app suddenly thought I was driving in random directions a half mile off the interstate. In every case I had to swipe up on the app and restart to get it back into working mode. This is unusually buggy--even for a Google product--and could be dangerous in some circumstances."

        "content": "I'm on the road 8 months out of the year. Having a useful navigational app is key for the remote destinations I travel to in the US. When they released the 'offline maps' feature, I was absolutely thrilled and it worked great. Of course, this option is only available for the map view and not satellite view. This was unfortunate, but as long as I scrolled through the location in satellite mode, the app cached the images which worked ok. After the latest updates, the app no is longer caching satellite images which is a BIG disappointment. Why this app doesn't allow you to save satellite imagery for offline mode is beyond me.\n\nOther annoying attributes to the app are constant route changes (not authorized by me), vocal updates you cannot mute unless ALL notifications are muted, and the 'You will arrive at 7:02PM' notification after starting your route. Hey developers, not everyone cares when they're going to arrive at their destination! There's already an ETA listed on the screen. I don't need the creepy vocals telling me the same info.\n\nLastly, as others pointed out, too many icons on the main screen."

As I waited for her awesome boss Jo-Jo cleaned my pandora bracelet I began to converse with Jayme. We discovered we had something in common, which is the worse type of pain one could ever endure, which is the loss of a mother. Jayme has lost both parents, and I will pray her strength continues. On the other hand. Jayme stated, \"let me show you something, that I know your going to like.\" Mind you I didn't ask her anything but what I knew I already desired. It was two hearts that had \"mother\" and \"daughter\" on one side and \"Your Are Always in My Heart\" on the other side. PERFECT!!! Exactly what I been desiring for almost a year now. Nothing say something special when it have meaning. Her boss was just as awesome and helpful. ❤️❤️❤️"

The website allowed me to put in the address, but then refused to do anything until I downloaded the app, essentially tricking/forcing me to do so. I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if I had been driving. After being forced to download the app, I opened it assuming I would finally get directions for the address I had typed into the website. However, the system just continued in a loop with the website sending me back to the app, and strangely, the app sending me back to the website where I had typed in the directions. I was driving by this time, so it was dangerous for me to be messing with my phone. I never did get it to work, and as a result, my children missed an Easter egg hunt. I guess I should count my blessings that this was the only consequence, as opposed to a potentially serious traffic accident caused by struggling with google's incompetence."

Ex, I was driving north tonight, the app for some reason thought I turned around south and rerouted. But I hadn't deviated course at all. I've been using google maps for several years and have never had any type of issue like this and now have had several instances recently where the app seems to lose the direction I'm traveling and rerouted.

It's one of the best feature from Maps, but I have confidence in your dev team that you guys can replicate the feature.

It remembers your preference and automatically avoid tolls by default. Isn't that amazing? Go check it out."

Good luck finding that. I looked everywhere and it seems to simply not be available anywhere anymore .… in this MAP TOOL!!!! \n\nWhat was wrong with cycling between destination/route time and distance?

I swear that nearly every time I'm close to identifying something really important that my Garmin can't find, my finger hits the centering button and the entire map shifts to my current location. It is the most annoying and frustrating feature of this app. It's because it's in the lower right hand corner, where you typically either type or hold the device.  If that button were in the upper left or right corner, where you could only touch if you intended to touch it, it would make all the difference.  So, beware of hitting that button when you least want to.  A great app will suddenly find itself a good to marginal one."

So after studying for some time, one day while at my dermatologist's office I was able to read reviews and see pictures of Dr Yellin's work. I decided that day that this was the surgeon.  I was scared and afraid to go under the knife, but upon going to Dr Yellin's office, he and his staff made me feel secure and confident to proceed. The big day came. I had been drilled with post-op instructions. The surgery center was professional and I felt safe. I was off to the OR. For the first two weeks after surgery I wondered if I would ever be ok  The vinegar soaks were my life saver. But after about 6 weeks I knew I had made the right decision and was very happy. I could wear eye liner again! It has been 3 months now. You can barely see the incisions and the redness under my eyes from the laser has almost gone. Dr. Yellin does under eye laser when doing the lower eyelid bags. I recently had a get together with some of my retired friends and this was the comment\"You look so good\". They  never had a clue I look so natural. I am very happy and pleased.  Thank u Dr Yellin."

I've actually started using Apple maps since they have improving. Google needs to get their driving team back out and improve this app before it becomes a thing of the past. Google should also seriously consider using the app themselves in every major city, to see the issues they're having. If a destination location has multiple entrances, this app should know which is the main entrance and lead drivers to it, not the closest entrance, specifically gated communities.

Street view is pretty much the only reason to even use Google Maps over the built in Apple Maps application. This doesn't happen on my iPhone 7 or my iPad Air 2 or my wife's release edition IPad Pro 12.9 so it's got to be some kind of incompatibility with the new Pros.

Just now you had me go past the place I was going, told me to turn right, do a u-turn, turn back onto the road I was just on and into the place I'm going. Thankfully I saw the place and just turned around in the next parking lot. Hopefully the person who programmed you to do that is found and fired. May his little games be ended soon. So, it's time that we part ways. Farewell google maps."

        "content": "Our organisation has been renting from entreprise for more than 10 years, I've been the one in charge of this matter. not once have I had an issue till this week. I needed a 15 seaters van for a couple of hours, the local branch I deal with could not find one, I did not give them enough notice . I finally was able to reserve one but from the airport location... that was a nightmare ... I got there to be told if I'm using the organisation business  credit card, it had to have my name and picture on it, which is nonsense to me, but I did respect the policies of the company, I tried to use my debit card that I had on me, well I was told I could not since I should present the associate with an around trip ticket in order to accept my debit card ... I was amazed to hearing this, knowing I only have about 90 mns to take my campers where they had to be ... there were 5 employees behind the counter, one of them stepped up, questioned what the issue was, I explained to him what was going on ... he said there was nothing he could do about it ... I told him they should have explained to me all these details during the reservation ... and then another nightmare started, he asked me how I reserved a van in his location, by now I knew he was the floor manager ... I explained to him I did so because the local branch could not help me also when I called his location I could not speak to anyone since it seemed they were busy, that my call was picked up by a Barbara who happened to be up stairs from his counter, he said there was no Barbara upstairs, he denied her existence just because he did not know who she was ...\nBarbara, if you are one of the people who will read this, please go downstairs and introduce yourself to DJ, he said he was managing the BWI location  for 6 years, time for him to know that entreprise has an office at the airport and that you, Barbara work in it ....\nI told him that she could not help me she put me back on queue, after a long wait  I got a live person who said he was in Guatemala ... here where the floor manager became sarcastic, saying that because someone helped me in a different language, did not mean they were in Guatemala... that was very stupid since I spoke no Spanish, he did assume that I was a Spanish speaker which I'm not ... he made sure that all his employees and all the customers that were there heard him saying that enterprise has no call center in Guatemala, his eyes rolled a few times , I realized there was no reason for me to continue this conversation ... I had to call somebody else to come and use  his card and we completed the rental ... \nI tried to call and make arrangement to drop the van at my local branch did not feel like coming near the airport twice the same day,  guess what people , I got the enterprise call center in Guatemala again, I was told I would have to pay $50 if I return the vehicle to a different location !!!! \nSo, to the BWI floor manager of 6 years, I will take may business elsewhere as you suggested, but ignorance is not an excuse for not knowing , you owe an apology to your employees , coworkers that you choose  not  to acknowledge and your company that pays your check ... next time you may run into someone who will mention that they have made reservations through Guatemala entreprise call center, don't roll your eyes, because there is a center in Guatemala and they all speak fluent English ...."

Typing the address into Apple maps pretty much gave me the same toll-infested routes as Google maps did. Fortunately or Unfortunately (I don't know how to feel about this), after cursing out siri, it actually gave me the toll-free route."

Specifically, I was trying out both Google Maps and Apple Maps in Tokyo on a recent trip and found the Apple app easier to use because of the lock-screen view functionality.  I could whip my phone out of my pocket every 5 minutes to verify I was still on course.  That being said, I usually confirm a route from Apple Maps or Waze with Google Maps because they seem to have better routing algorithms sometimes.  I still have them all on my phone."

        "content": "Hey is it possible that you can stop causing my map to turn up north every time I use the app it's very annoying.  Additionally it is nice to drive routes without tolls when I drove I have to click three buttons just to turn it off then remap I'm sure google knows most people use their maps to map locations while actively driving. I would like to instantly switch from the option to take tolls route or non tolls routes from the navigation screen without having to hit the map icon inbetween switches.  We should be able to hit a button after we locate our destination hit map.. after it maps it should have a icon on the map saying tolls/ toll off and we can switch it any point without having to hit the map it screen. It should automatically change the same way it does when you miss a turn. This is an easy fix for your programmers please I'm sure others feel the same way.    Thank u .. btw you are wayyy better then apple maps. Give them pointers lol__ iPhone 7 + google maps--- also can u make it so we can see map on iPhone screen when locked similar to apple map. It kills your battery life"

        "content": "This was the best gps app that I've used for a long time until lately. This app is alway trying to auto reroute you to the fastest route. This isn't always the way you would like to take, only giving a few seconds to click to stay on your intended route. Ive had to backtrack and waste gas, money and time because of this. An example of the reroute problem is when going from Indianapolis to a suburb of Chicago I choose a route that went through Bloomington, IL to avoid the Chicago traffic which can take hours. This app rerouted me to go right through Chicago, even after I selected a path around. Why have the option if it is alway trying to change it. I really expected more google."

        "content": "However, it is not great on iPad Pro.  It is simply being scaled up from the smaller iPad size.  This makes the app look like crap on the iPad Pro.  Please update the app with native support for iPad Pro.\n\nUpdate on 7/29/2017: I have become a huge fan of Google Maps since I wrote my original review.  I love several things about it:\n\n1) the offline maps is a huge benefit compared to Apple Maps.  I have spent significant time overseas recently, and having the maps available offline is a lifesaver.\n\n2) the reviews built into Google Maps is much better than Apple Maps.  I found them very helpful in deciding where to go on several occasions.  I have also started contributing to Google reviews. \n\nIf Google Maps were available on Apple CarPlay I would probably literally never use Apple Maps again."

The voice speaks clearly and at a good tempo, and you are given a heads up when you run into traffic. Even if you don't love this app, you should have it as a backup as you will find it useful at some point when your other resources have failed you. Highly recommend."

        "content": "Since then most recent update, it cannot seem to pinpoint where I am - thus causing me to miss turns that are fairly close to each other (and some that aren't). Living near a major city, and being here only a year, I rely on maps to help me get around a fair amount. I have good service and am not in the boonies.... so I'm not sure why suddenly it's hard to locate me for following my route. Often it takes several seconds to realize I've turned and sometimes it rerouted thinking I've done something I shouldn't. Makes following the directions very confusing and unhelpful. Please: Help!"

        "content": "Doesn't integrate properly with Lyft or Uber driver apps. Worthless. Why haven't you fixed this yet? This bug has not only existed for over a year or longer, but it's gotten worse! In the Lyft app, when it auto navigates or I have to click on the Navigate Tab (auto navigate is turned on and it works fine wth Waze), instead of navigating me, if I'm lucky you'll show me a \"preview\" of the route to the given address but you won't navigate me there. I have to back out of that function at least two steps in hopes that you'll sometimes give me the option to manually tap on the little \"go\" button or the little triangle to finally get directions from your broken app. Waze integrates perfectly with Lyft but I don't feel safe using Waze because it lacks lane assist technology. It's too unsafe to spend all my time and energy taking my eyes of the road just to fight with your app in hopes to make it work for me before my passenger cancels on me. You're supposed to be the best navigation app out there. You've let me down, Google. You've let Uber down. You've let Lyft down. You've let every customer they both have down. I'm very disappointed in you. I have no choice but to delete your app. You would be my go to app, but you're not safe enough for rideshare drivers. Half the time I have to close Google Maps and restart it just to get it to work with Lyft while in traffic. The auto navigate function including route pickup/drop off/stop changes and auto cancel route functions along with a button for easy switching between Google Maps and the rideshare driver's app should work just as it does with Waze. Worthless. Get with the programmers for Uber and Lyft and fix these dangerous problems."

I no longer got on that main road, & my cell had COMPLETELY lot all cell phone service. No bars whatsoever. So for a good ten minutes I had to use my better judgment and had decided to go straight down that road. I even tried pressing the \"relocate\" button or whatever it's called. It would show me where I was and the miles I had until I got to my destination. I thought the whole point of downloading the area(s) of your choice, was to be able to get actual directions EVEN WHEN YOU WOULD HAVE NO SERVICE. switching to a different map 🗺 application. Like I said I liked it before. No issues.\nIt had also glitches a couple times here and there. Good app. Just needs some improvement."

        "content": "Google Maps is my go-to online map.  There is so many things I like about Google Maps for iPad, it would be impractical even to begin to list them, so I'll go straight for the things that need improvement. \n\nIt doesn't play nice with iPad photos, unlike the browser version for iPad.  With the browser version I can get to any photo on my iPad, but with the app I can only get to certain photos, and I'm never quite clear which ones.  I would not be surprised to learn that that is mostly Apple's fault (\"bone-headed choice by Apple\" used to be a much rarer event a number of years ago), but work it out.  \n\nThese following aren't really an app-specific problems, but they affect the app:\nWhile the error Rate is low, that leaves many errors.  Errors tend to fall into four categories, markers that don't function properly, markers with incorrect information or location, markers for real places are lacking or don't show up even zoomed all the way in and incorrect street/road names.  The last is rarest, and often results from a multiplicity of names (e.g., Lincoln Highway might also be 7th St. and County-2 and Illinois-38 and US-20 as a slightly made up example) or directions sometimes get mixed into a name (S. East Ave. somehow [mostly because of lack of proper punctuation] became Southeast Ave.).  The problem with these errors is that it can be quite difficult or clunky to correct them.  Mapmaker is at best user-unfriendly, though making corrections via the Google Maps is slightly better.  And I say that having a current 94-95% approval rate on around 800 edits.  \n\nWhile the last isn't directly a problem with the Google Maps App for iPad, and while I definitely see the need for controls in changes to the content of Google Maps, the app can't get better until Mapmaker does.\n\nUpdate:  The newest update to Google Maps for iPad plays even-less with iPad Photos, and this time it's definitely Google's fault — it crops the photo I'm trying to post.  If I wanted the photo to be some other shape, I'd crop it myself."

There needs to be an easier way to report incorrect directions. Doing so with the \"report an issue\" option seems to pertain more so to the specific details of a location. The road closure data needs to be more accurate too. Apple Maps and Waze have up to date information, you'd think GM would as well."

It also will change your route in the middle of you driving if you get caught in traffic, which is extremely confusing and gets you lost. I'm not sure what changed because I don't remember Google Maps sucking this much, but it's awful and I'm currently trying to find a GPS system that isn't as crappy."

Among many things, the worst was the fact that instead of taking in the top properly she literally put a seem down the front of her dress; which would've been seen in every picture. Just to get the full idea the lady had a bowl of chips sitting right next to her dress when we walked in. We were so upset we just wanted to get the dress and get out of there. After telling multiple people at Darianna and showing them pictures they assured us they would make it right. They were horrified as well but after speaking to the owner she said she was not there and we would have to get our money back from the seamstress ourselves. HAH, like we ever want to see that lady again! So after paying for my sister's alterations TWICE, Darianna has done nothing to make it right."

I only wish I could get it to synchronize with my calendar like my iPhone Map app does because that app isn't as good as Google Maps. Also, allowing Waze incidents into the Google Map app isn't the best idea. It showed two accidents in my area this morning that didn't exist and of course, I couldn't delete the false alarms. It could also use a detour button. A stop at the grocery store on the way to granny's is not technically a \"detour\". Anyway, I trust Google Maps will work out the bugs."

It also sometimes doesn't know the direction I am going in navigation mode and this is not compass interference because when I have Apple maps running at the same time it doesn't have any problem."

We invested in stainless steel appliances, granite counters, new tiles in areas, all new carpeting, etc. You get the point. The top of icing was to be the PAINT JOB, inside & out. Being a registered nerd & proud of it, I researched \"Painters\" & interviewed several. Read reviews carefully & the choice was obvious:  AZ West Painting & owner, Chris Arevalo. Every review was overwhelmingly positive! Our experience:  fantastic crew of five. They came early & worked all day, leaving promptly at 4:30pm., giving us our house back. They \"attacked\" the job with energy, gentle care & yet respectfully left the kitchen, the bedroom, TV's accessible to the point we were the least bit inconvenienced under the circumstances. The care with which the furniture was moved & our sentimental delicate picture frames, paintings & artifacts handled was comforting. The paint inside & outside was excellent.\nBut, above all, after the work was done, Chris, the owner, walked us thro' the final inspection as though it was HIS house! Everything that we asked him to do, be it remove an inefficient mister, or land line phone plates, he did it without charge & good cheer, a nod & a smile! Chris & his crew were determined to please us, & by Jove, they DID IT!! It's obviously part of this AZ West Painting culture, & mission statement.  My wife & I are completely satisfied & grateful for the excellent work. We recommend AZ West Painting, Chris the owner & his crew: great work at a fair price!!\nNash & Hooty"

I searched for Home Depot. Instead of giving me a list of choices, with spots on the map, so I could choose the closest one, it asked me to choose from three choices by address. How the heck am I supposed to know?! That's why I'm asking Google. \n\nAfter fiddling around some more, I found a list with distances and chose the one that seemed to be closest. We followed directions and hit there, but it wasn't the location I expected. On the way back, we passed the expected location, 5 miles closer to home (we could have avoided 2 trips through the \"spaghetti bowl\" at 4:30 pm). \n\nAlso, I need to be able to turn off the Pacman  game. It is irritating and in my way."

Also I've found that GM sometimes just doesn't say anything when I need a direction. For example over the weekend it said to \"bear right\" as I was passing an exit, when i found out later that it actually should have said to get off at an exit. Also, sometimes it shows me my route in the actual direction I'm driving, rather than positioning the road in the driver view (in other words if I'm driving west to east it displays the road left-to-right horizontally across the screen.) I've reinstalled the app hoping that this will improve things but overall I'm very disappointed with the latest version."

So, good and not quite as good. I recommend trying (and using) both depending on the situation."

Here's why, one, I didn't want to part with $600, next I had this program on my phone. But the clincher was a buddy bought a 17 Jeep Lariat with nav. I took a drive with him and it was slow, didn't reroute u, didn't recognize construction or detours. \n\nSo 5 stars from me.\n\nCheers Len"

First the traffic sometimes doesn't work I try restarting the app turning the traffic off and back on again and nothing works. Sometimes this last for a few minutes sometimes an hour or two. My second complaint is when navigating on street/ satellite mode I've been experiencing some issues. It used to be the little arrows you would click to move now a solid blue line that you slide your finger along to move. The problem is there are certain streets where he goes back and forth from the arrow to the blue line. Also the blue lines are not straight sometimes there's weird shapes that may look like a couple triangles in an intersection this makes it really difficult to move. Sometimes I spend a minute or two just trying to move the map. Also I don't like if your paining the camera around or trying to zoom into a location it always seems to move the map on you. I hope this system can be better in a graded in the future and works more seamlessly. \n\n                     🎈Thanks Google🎈"

You need to give users the ability to separate your apps and not have the same user data and account info intermingled between them.  I don't think you people realize how invasive that is and how much people want to safeguard their identity... oh, but that's right, you're Google, so that should be of no surprise."

        "content": "When the app offers to reroute you because it's found a shorter or better route and you don't respond it automatically takes you on the most horrible back alley or pig path roads that you cannot recover from. When you are driving alone you can't watch the screen and take your hands off the wheel to tap the \"no thanks\" tab. The app chooses the new route and some of these roads are two lane, dark, narrow roads that no one would want to be on.  You should be able to lock in your chosen route and only be rerouted if you have taken a wrong turn or exit. The rerouting should only take you to your chosen route that you have locked in. \nOther than this. The app was wonderful with so many helps for drivers before this bug. But now I would not feel safe to drive alone trusting Google maps to get me there. \nGoogle maps used to beat iPhone maps hands down but now I must go back to the IPhone Map app for safety sake."

I have to tap the screen again, hoping the screen doesn't lock, to get phone back and go back to car sharing app. If I'm on a street where it's tough to find the address, I need the map to stay active.

You click avoid highways but really it means major interstates.\n\nThird; I remember I could just drag the route I wanted to take. Is that feature gone or hidden in the numerous menus?\n\nFourth; I just....I just hate the direction this app has taken. Its not even smart."

There is a certain 6 lane intersection and there is a road right before where you can only go to the right because if your try to turn left like it wants you to then you'll have to cross 3 lanes of oncoming traffic plus there are signs on that street to not turn left. I've encountered situations like this before. For that reason it is not a 5 star review. Also it won't let me download its latest version even though I have more than enough space for it."

With the downloadable maps, it greatly eases demand on your data limits and frees you up to use it more frequently. The voice speaks clearly and at a good tempo, and you are given a heads up – and a automatic re-routing when you run into traffic. If that weren't enough, it gives you a Welcome greeting every time you cross a state line. Even if you don't love this app, you should have it as a backup as you will find it useful at some point when your other resources have failed you. Highly recommend."

        "title": "Still waiting on those bug fixes", 
        "content": "Update doesn't fix the annoying bar along the bottom. How on earth would directions to home be useful to me, while sitting at home? Moreover, the app often ignores the first tap on the search bar, to pull up the bar along the bottom. I've tapped \"this is not useful\" and \"thanks I've got it\" COUNTLESS times but it will not go away. I can't find a way to disable this useless feature that wastes data by calculating unnecessary drive times. \n\nIs there a setting to make the \"remember settings\" toggle, remember to stay on? It's so annoying to have to flip tolls and remember settings, but why should I if it doesn't stay? Anytime another app loads up a destination in google maps, \"avoid tolls\" and \"remember settings\" are both turned off. Why can't there be a quick toggle on the route planning screen for this?? \n\nGoogle, here's a bombshell, if there is physically NO other way to go, you do not need to give a direction. Any direction that says continue straight onto the road you're already on can be eliminated. \"Merge onto the access road\" is also not a direction! It is the result of taking an exit ramp. I'm talking about a 1 lane, 1 way ramp that goes from the highway, to the access road. There is no other option, unless Google thinks the user is about to U-TURN BACK ONTO THE HIGHWAY, you can eliminate this \"direction.\" Tell me what exit to take, and the VERY NEXT DIRECTION should be my next turn. When you stuff in the unnecessary direction of merging onto the access road, it hides the actual next direction. I need to know which lane I need to get in before the light ahead! This is useful information! But it's hidden behind a dummy \"direction.\" Same problem occurs with other dummy non-directions, because they always seem to come RIGHT before a real direction. \n\"Continue straight\"\nOkay, I'll stay in this middle lane in heavy traffic and continue straight. \n\"Turn right in 500 feet\"\nTHANKS. Now I have to go down and loop back, or dangerously and illegally cut off other people. \n\nSpeaking of dangerous and illegal, we should be able to tag directions as such within the app. I can't count the number of erroneous or illegal direction this app tries to make me pull. To \"correct\" it I have to screen shot it, remember it later, pull up the same route on the computer, and do it from there. I put \"correct\" in quotes because none have ever been fixed!! I could make a full time job out of proofing Google maps errors. Seriously, I'd do it, because I'm that sick and tired of getting garbage directions that cost time and money. \n\nPlease, please, PLEASE please give us a quicker way to toggle tolls. This wouldn't be an issue if maps didn't put such a giant priority on using them. MANY times I've turned tolls off to find my route time and/or distance has decreased. Yeah, thanks google, I'd really like to PAY to take the LONGER ROUTE. \n\nSpeaking of errors, the app often gets stuck on a previous direction. After you've made a turn, the green bar at the top still displays it as your next direction. No other spoken directions will be given when this happens. So if you've got your device locked, you won't know there's been an issue until you realize you've gone too far. Sure hope you know exactly where you're going. Oh wait, that's what this app is for. \n\nSpeaking of annoyances. When I'm sitting at a red light, there is no need to remind me of my next turn every 10 seconds or so. When locked, this turns the screen on, wasting battery. Locked or not, it will also speak the entire direction, again, over whatever you're trying to play. I watched this happen 12 TIMES IN A ROW WHILE SITTING STILL before I closed the app. Very common, easily reproducible, just stop at a sign, light, or traffic for a little bit. \n\nSearch along route has been fixed, which is nice. I'm getting the constant rerouting error less. \n\nSTILL will not stop telling me to turn on wifi. I get it! I know wifi helps! It would be on if I were somewhere with wifi!! Do you think there's wifi in the middle of nowhere, or that I have time to connect to a coffee shop as I roll past on the highway? I think everyone with an iPhone knows it has wifi. But if you still feel the need to let us know, MAKE IT JUST ONE TIME!!! I've had the phone and app for YEARS and it STILLLLLLLL tries to 'remind' me to turn on wifi, for no reason other than to waste battery. Seriously, stop bothering your users."

You can see where your next turn is if it's close but I think the greatest benefit would be being able to see if the alternate route makes more sense. I find myself manually zooming when I'm working my way around the city during peak traffic."

The first ended quickly when it couldn’t find my street (>1 million population urban area, plotted 1931, built 1959) and showed a road going across what is nothing but water. Both have been fixed.\n\nMy issue is the integration with iOS Contacts is terrible. At best, what you want is buried in a list of Google identified locations (as in businesses that want your money). However, and unfortunately, as much as you look for the location you want to go to, its not there, not in the list. I've tried repeatedly and cannot get the Contacts access to work consistently. 9 out of 10 times, Google Maps does not pick up a contact thats in my Contacts list.\n\nWhich means typing in addresses. Not names as you will get a Google list. Want to tell it to take you to the \"Murphy's\", good luck, it will show \"Murphy's 1,000 miles away but not the one up the street that's in your Contacts app. The actual address is needed. Apparantly voice search does not access Contacts, or its utterly useless. \n\nIf you want to be led around by Google, do it. If you're an iOS user and want to get somewhere reasonably efficiently, go back to Maps. Google can locate more addresses than Maps, but the process of getting a route is the pits."

        "content": "Overall, a very good navigation app apart from a few irritating things that need improvement:\n\nFirstly, Google should understand the importance of rush hour traffic both in the morning as well as the evening time and not force users to make left turns through uncontrolled intersections during heavy traffic and / or gridlock when people are rushing to get to work or their child to school. People who are not familiar with the area will be forced to make that turn causing more traffic congestion or the increased risk of an accident. Google needs to re-write their code to prevent those dangerous left turns during rush hour. \n\nSecondly, there needs to be a feature of auto accept when a faster route is available because when a person is driving and is not able to look away from the road to click accept, something happens to the display, the direction of travel displayed gets messed up as in, while viewing the direction of travel gets stuck on west to east and cannot be changed regardless of zoom or two finger swipe, the display does not change and we have to shut down the app and reopen to correct the issue. \n\nFinally, we all use our computers to print map directions, but for some people, their smartphones are what they need to manage everything without the need for a PC, so there needs to be an option for printing in the google maps app as well because if one cannot download an offline map due to either a space limitation or due to having an old phone that is slow, atleast a printed direction can come in handy."

        "content": "Google Maps is my go-to online map.  There is so many things I like about Google Maps for iPad, it would be impractical even to begin to list them, so I'll go straight for the things that need improvement. \n\nIt doesn't play nice with iPad photos, unlike the browser version for iPad.  With the browser version I can get to any photo on my iPad, but with the app I can only get to certain photos, and I'm never quite clear which ones.  I would not be surprised to learn that that is mostly Apple's fault (\"bone-headed choice by Apple\" used to be a much rarer event a number of years ago), but work it out.  \n\nThese following aren't really an app-specific problems, but they affect the app:\nWhile the error Rate is low, that leaves many errors.  Errors tend to fall into four categories, markers that don't function properly, markers with incorrect information or location, markers for real places are lacking or don't show up even zoomed all the way in and incorrect street/road names.  The last is rarest, and often results from a multiplicity of names (e.g., Lincoln Highway might also be 7th St. and County-2 and Illinois-38 and US-20 as a slightly made up example) or directions sometimes get mixed into a name (S. East Ave. somehow [mostly because of lack of proper punctuation] became Southeast Ave.).  The problem with these errors is that it can be quite difficult or clunky to correct them.  Mapmaker is at best user-unfriendly, though making corrections via the Google Maps is slightly better.  And I say that having a current 94-95% approval rate on around 800 edits.  \n\nWhile the last isn't directly a problem with the Google Maps App for iPad, and while I definitely see the need for controls in changes to the content of Google Maps, the app can't get better until Mapmaker does.\n\nUpdate:  The newest update to Google Maps for iPad plays even-less well with iPad Photos, and this time it's definitely Google's fault — it crops the photo I'm trying to post.  If I wanted the photo to be some other shape, I'd crop it myself.\n\nNew Update:  New update to GMfi, and (going against the recent trend wherein major software firms work diligently to make their software less usable), now the auto-cropping is gone AND suddenly it plays nice with iPad Photos; I can find and choose any of the 20,000+ photos on it.  Well done.  Now, if you can make the insertion point for StreetView correspond more closely to the point marked in the overhead view, that should get it to five stars.\n\n4.30.0 update — No matter what I've tried, I can't get this update to show satellite views, or much else from overhead among other problems.  (A couple days later this resolved itself.)\n\n4.33.1 update — Once again, GM doesn't play nice with Photos, worse than before.  That's a BIG step backwards.  We are not amused.  Also, the insertion point for StreetView remains problematic.  Down to 3*, or even 2½*."

Buford stood me up a man called me at 7:30AM on a Saturday I scheduled an appointment anyway and waited for an hour before leaving and heading to Atlanta where before I could step out of the car I was being pressured to buy today and over my price range I never went back my friend just so happens to call me and refer me to the right direction to Sheryl Mazzeo \nThanks again \nDaniel Beauchamp"

Now with the new version, while in route, you have to tap on \"menu\", then tap \"settings\" which gives you a drop-down menu, then (again, all while driving) your eyes have to search through a long list of options to find and select \"show traffic on map\", then tap on the activation button. This is way too many steps while driving. Please bring back the previous option or create an option to quickly be able to add traffic view & remove traffic view quickly without taking focus off the road. Thank you so much.

I'm about to stop accepting any updates from Google maps. Sometimes it takes forever for the view to upload in the past but now it doesn't. Thanks google for screwing up again. So how long will it be before you fix it this time? One point it took you 6 months to fix. Stop adding so much unecessary crap to the app that slows it down. Can we get a update to fix the delay?"

Until the latest update of the app, it used to work perfectly (or as well as any app can on a six year-old device) but now whenever I've chosen my destination and clicked the drive button, it just crashes. It stutters for about 15 seconds and then force-closes. It's a real shame as Google Maps is my favourite navigation app and I'm really hoping they fix this issue in the next update."

They helped me dropping off my rental, getting insurance for my car, and even to get the EZ Pass.\nTheir facility is amazing. While you wait, you can get free drinks and snacks in a very couzy ambiance. Mr Hung also got me a great discount on the car after discussing it with his manager.\nI strongly recommend anyone to visit Herb Chambers when looking for a car. Ask for Mr Hung\n\nIsaac Sherman"

In the Google Maps app the search bar can be used to type in the names of places and it will locate them for you. Google maps will also bring up suggestions of similar places. The Apple Maps doesn't seem to have as many locations that are readily searchable if you don't already have the address. Updating your app and it's functionality should be at the top of your list."

It's immensely distracting when driving which is not good for a navigation app. I've seen numerous reports of this but still never seen or heard anything about fixes from google. \n\nAlso to note, Apple Maps and Waze do not have this problem when navigating. Just Google Maps. \n\n----------\n\nOverall Google Maps is definitely the best maps app out there with the abundance of data they've got for places around your area. I've had some trouble trying to see public transport information as I simply just can't find it, even when turning transit on and tapping on the station the train leaves from."

Now it's open app, tap, tap, zoom. I realize this may sound like a trivial issue but, given the number of times I do this per day, it seriously adds up. And, frankly, I can't think of any viable reason for the interface change which makes it even more frustrating. Google, I've already rolled back to the previous version (4.35.1) and am seriously considering my alternativees."

Apple Maps brought it right up. I've had the same experience with Waze working with no problem. And I have to agree with another reviewer that the options are kind of buried in the app and therefore are difficult to access, like getting from the map screen to saved places. Navigation itself messes up fairly often, which is a disaster in work situations not to mention going to events like weddings when you absolutely need to be there by a certain time. Also the font is huge and everything that pops up takes up a lot of screen space. I'm a big fan of Google apps in general, but this one needs some work."

This is a first class faculty run by a great doctor who is also an Army Reservist. Bristol is very fortunate to have this facility and I am positive that if the need arises in the future for medical care I shall return."

I input 50-100 destinations every morning and now each and every time I add one, there is an additional step before I can mark the location. To make it worse I have an additional step upon removing each and every star. This should be something you select in another fashion that doesn't require people needing a speedy completion, when we've grown accustomed to the ease and usability of the prior version. If I didn't rely on it for GPS so heavily I'd delete it. I'm looking into the Apple Maps as an alternate, and that's saying something. Get your act together and make things easier, not a lengthier process GOOGLE."

After spotting an ASP truck on Virginia Beach Blvd. I decided to call. Boy am I glad I did. I can't say enough good things about Bill Schlemmer. Not only did he do everything that he said he would but he went above and beyond. Before I even signed a contract, a tropical system hit the area. Bill knew we were out of town. He called me to see if it was alright if he stopped by the house to see about the water level. He graciously lowered the water level for me. The renovation went smoothly but a short time after, the remnants of hurricane Matthew affected the area, again I was out of town. He took care of the pool which was overflowing and full of debris. Additionally, because the pool had overflowed, the water chemistry was totally thrown off. It took a little bit of time and patience but he corrected the imbalance. If you want exemplary service with a smile then I highly recommend ASP pools, Bill and his friendly staff. \n\nMelissa\nVirginia Beach"

        "content": "This is my all time favorite navigation app. The only downside that I wish it had was where you can adjust the arrival and departure time like you can on the desktop version. When I'm typically going to a new destination, the night before I like to Google Map how long it will take, but I obviously need to adjust it to the time I'm leaving in the morning to see that predicted traffic time. So I always have to pull out my laptop and do it. I wish the iPhone app would have this compatibility because it would make it so much easier to plan future trips at the convenience of my phone rather than always having to go grab my laptop."

And I am so glad we did. \n\nI knew the minute I started talking to Felipe he could be trusted. He and his crew have done a fantastic job. They are honest, hard working, Christian people who know their business and are willing to do whatever it takes to do the job right and to your satisfaction. This also goes for any subcontractors  he sends to do additional work. They are all very trustworthy, polite, hardworking people and when they are finished, they clean up every piece of paper, nail, shingle and smallest piece of debris left in your yard or neighbor's  yard. \n\nI cannot say enough good things about Felipe and Vera construction. My son is using him for repairs to his home and I have asked Felipe if he would do the repairs on our house at the coast that was damaged by Hurricane Harvey. \n\nI will recommend Vera Roofing and Construction to anyone and everyone I can."

This app not only tells you which lane to get in before turning at multiple lane intersections, but, most importantly, this app also tells you on which side of the street the target address is located. There is also a smooth, almost unnoticeable, in-transit correction to a new route when the driver disagrees with the originally programmed route and decides to follow an alternate route. The major limitation of this navigation app is that there is no speed monitor or speed limit notification. Because of this limitation, I can not give this app five stars. 🎭"

I believe it's a part of Waze but nice that's it's available in Google Maps. \n\nI also love that I can do a search for a restaurant or pharmacy and all nearby areas pop up on my map. \n\nLastly, try the offline feature when traveling overseas and you don't have mobile service or Wifi. Route your area while connected to a network and save the area for offline viewing and navigating. Life saver when you don't have a connection. :)"

It prompted me again to choose another route 20 minutes later when I was driving. I did not choose because I was driving and it automatically changed my route. Before I noticed my route was changed, we are going the wrong direction. Thanks a lot Google Maps! Guess my plans will have to change because of your glitches."

Since digital maps came out I have used Google-maps 95% of the time. The other 5% is when like IPhone or Ipad automatically opens in Apples-maps. Wish I could change the default mapping app, on iPhone and iPad to Google Maps app so I wouldn't have to copy and paste the address of my next meeting address into Google maps from my calendar app instead of just tapping the address and it going to the google maps app by default. When you pay as much as you do for the iPhone and iPad you should be able to use it like you want and not be forced. \nI am a Windows person and wish that the windows phone would become popular so that the people who build all these wonderful apps would make them for the windows phone. There is so much more you can do with Windows so why is it that Mac PC's are more expensive??? Never did get that. They must think they themselves are worth all that extra money and take it from you.

        "content": "I used to love google maps but lately it's just awful. The navigation voice sometimes doesn't talk or if it finally decides to it will tell me turn left after I just past the turn. Other times it will give me a list of directions but doesn't update after you have followed directions so you have to scroll through it while driving to see the next one. It gets easily confused in busy city areas or even along highways. It gets me lost and wastes more gas than it's worth. The only reason I keep it is because when I google unknown store locations it's a lot easier to press the directions button and get immediate directions than copying & pasting the address into another gps app. I hope they fix this I know google is trying to expand its features but the app should at least be able to do the original basic functions it was made to do."

My best feature is the grey alternate route with the ETA. That has saved me so many times!"

Much of the functionality is missing too, e.g. Measuring distance or path, viewing older images of the same place, etc.  I prefer to either use the PC version or use Google Maps.  Maps has more up to date images and great search functions. So, the Google Earth app doesn't add much or anything to that."

Thank-you Google keep it up. Does eat battery but then that's your fault if you don't take a car charger for your iPhone with you when driving somewhere you aren't familiar with while using a GPS app. If you use a moniker phone based GPS app please plan ahead and either bring a charger and or a spate power bank to keep your phone from running out of power at exactly the wrong time and place. In this modern world payphones barely exist anymore in the USA. Failure to plan ahead can leave you stranded without a way to connect to someone who can send help to get you home safely."

Much more difficult to use when driving as now it's an extra step.\n\n2) why put a large \"Exit\" icon on the main nav. screen? The old \"X\" was fine on the left, which made room for the route preview button.\n\n3) \"Press to accept\" alternate route announcement disappears much too quickly, and here you DO need a big icon to safely press when driving."

They let me pay in cash and said they had no other means of collecting payment from me. No mobile apps or such. I paid my deposit for the hotel room and fee for one night. The next morning I requested that the hotel charge my meals for three days to my room so that I could pay with my friends card (he is with me). The hotel refused. I explained that I had very little cash and I was just starting my trip. I begged them to help me. Still they refused. I now am staying across the alley at  same price 600 bhat airconditioning and bathroom in the room (wild orchid shared bathroom down the hall 600 bhat) new Guest house 200 deposit wild orchid 1500 deposit. Wild orchid will not help you if you have problems and the hired help is sarcastic and rude. Thai customer service is much better in most places that I have experienced.

Siri is superior just for clarity. Also Google Maps recently started mispronouncing many street names I frequent when it didn't do so before. You'd think google text to speech would be more accurate than Apple's. \n\nScrolling through maps is kind of laggy, especially compared to Apple maps.\n\nWhen you search for directions somewhere then exit the app and come back, the directions are often still there, and you need to press the back arrow in the top left, then the x button in the top right, then type something in and press the directions button in the bottom right just to get directions to a new place!!! Ridiculously inefficient.\n\nFor comparison Apple maps is pressing the x button 2 or 3 times in the exact same spot for the same result - much less rage inducing. \n\nMap data with roads & points of interest are still likely superior to all competitors and it is worth it to keep this app installed just for that.\n\nHowever, sometimes people over report road closures or accidents where they don't exist, like I have some neighbors that report a nearby throughway is closed because they don't like the traffic, even though it's open. There should be more vetting for these reports."

Why wouldn't someone test such an important feature before releasing an update. It's a crying shame that your users have to bring this to your attention. I see that many others are having the same problem. It used to be a 5 star app. Please fix this issue ASAP.\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n 开发者回复：Thank you for letting us know about this issue, and your patience as we fixed the problem. We appreciate it! With the latest update, Google Maps should now be working as usual."

If strictly following a south-north route per position, I cannot read ascertain what's ahead. It automaticaly used compass, cunfusing my direction.\n4. On occasion, it does not provide route options at all, though I know they are available.\n5. Does not specify clearly which direction to take (nor in advance) when getting to a multiple fork in the road. I've been left in the middle of traffic- not knowing which way to go, then having to make loops to circle back again.\n6. Some street signs hidden (trees), unreadable (totally sun-bleached), not in time to read to decide if need to turn now or next block.

        "content": "Google Maps is my go-to online map.  There is so many things I like about Google Maps for iPad, it would be impractical even to begin to list them, so I'll go straight for the things that need improvement. \n\nIt doesn't play nice with iPad photos, unlike the browser version for iPad.  With the browser version I can get to any photo on my iPad, but with the app I can only get to certain photos, and I'm never quite clear which ones.  I would not be surprised to learn that that is mostly Apple's fault (\"bone-headed choice by Apple\" used to be a much rarer event a number of years ago), but work it out.  \n\nThese following aren't really an app-specific problems, but they affect the app:\nWhile the error Rate is low, that leaves many errors.  Errors tend to fall into four categories, markers that don't function properly, markers with incorrect information or location, markers for real places are lacking or don't show up even zoomed all the way in and incorrect street/road names.  The last is rarest, and often results from a multiplicity of names (e.g., Lincoln Highway might also be 7th St. and County-2 and Illinois-38 and US-20 as a slightly made up example) or directions sometimes get mixed into a name (S. East Ave. somehow [mostly because of lack of proper punctuation] became Southeast Ave.).  The problem with these errors is that it can be quite difficult or clunky to correct them.  Mapmaker is at best user-unfriendly, though making corrections via the Google Maps is slightly better.  And I say that having a current 94-95% approval rate on around 800 edits.  \n\nWhile the last isn't directly a problem with the Google Maps App for iPad, and while I definitely see the need for controls in changes to the content of Google Maps, the app can't get better until Mapmaker does.\n\nUpdate:  The newest update to Google Maps for iPad plays even-less well with iPad Photos, and this time it's definitely Google's fault — it crops the photo I'm trying to post.  If I wanted the photo to be some other shape, I'd crop it myself.\n\nNew Update:  New update to GMfi, and (going against the recent trend wherein major software firms work diligently to make their software less usable), now the auto-cropping is gone AND suddenly it plays nice with iPad Photos; I can find and choose any of the 20,000+ photos on it.  Well done.  Now, if you can make the insertion point for StreetView correspond more closely to the point marked in the overhead view, that should get it to five stars.\n\n4.30.0 update — no matter what I've tried, I can't get this update to show satellite views, or much else from overhead among other problems."

        "content": "I've had Google Maps for ten years on both platforms,Android and IOS, and this is one of the most advanced AI I've EVER seen in an App! It will not only provide navigation that is able to offer more efficient routes based on traffic patterns/accidents, but it learns your routines and will always conveniently have directions with ETA to destinations waiting in your notification bar. It really works at it's best when you're integrated more into the Google Ecosystem, having Apps like Google Calendars,   Gmail, Search Bar, etc. I highly recommend downloading those applications, especially Google Calendars and Gmail, because you'll find after adding a scheduled event, whether through Calendars itself or social media, that it'll have a scheduled appointment with an ETA through Google Maps directions waiting in your notification bar along with other routinely visited locations such as Home and Work. The more of the Google Ecosystem you use the more you'll get out of the application. Additionally, while driving you can still ask Siri or Google to do something like \"play music\", \"next track\", \"call ......\"(anyone), or ask questions to make your drive safer and allow you to keep your hands on the wheel/eyes on the road. Great Application! I wish more people would use the voice integration more to reduce traffic and accidents from looking at and touching there phones! Last side note, most people I know download Google Maps and when using navigation confuse the icon with Apple Maps, which is just labeled just Maps. I personally have moved the Maps folder widget rather into a separate folder or off my main home screen and replaced it with Google maps so that I don't mix them up and do the same for friends who use Maps instead of Google and I ALWAYS arrive at intended destination's faster and sometimes faster by quite a bit!"

We invested in stainless steel appliances, granite counters, new tiles in areas, all new carpeting, etc. You get the point. The top of icing was to be the PAINT JOB, inside & out. Being a registered nerd & proud of it, I researched \"Painters\" & interviewed several. Read reviews carefully & the choice was obvious:  AZ West Painting & owner, Chris Arevalo. Every review was overwhelmingly positive! Our experience:  fantastic crew of five. They came early & worked all day, leaving promptly at 4:30pm., giving us our house back. They \"attacked\" the job with energy, gentle care & yet respectfully left the kitchen, the bedroom, TV's accessible to the point we were the least bit inconvenienced under the circumstances. The care with which the furniture was moved & our sentimental delicate picture frames, paintings & artifacts handled was comforting. The paint inside & outside was excellent.\nBut, above all, after the work was done, Chris, the owner, walked us thro' the final inspection as though it was HIS house! Everything that we asked him to do, be it remove an inefficient mister, or land line phone plates, he did it without charge & good cheer, a nod & a smile! Chris & his crew were determined to please us, & by Jove, they DID IT!! It's obviously part of this AZ West Painting culture, & mission statement.  My wife & I are completely satisfied & grateful for the excellent work. We recommend AZ West Painting, Chris the owner & his crew: great work at a fair price!!\nNash & Hooty"

Someone thought it’d be a great idea to make it more like Waze.  On the future steps they shrunk the type to what seems to be below 6 point in WHITE.  Nearly impossible to read in a glance if you’re driving.  You can no longer tell which street is coming up that you need to turn on.  Whoever thought this improved the user experience either has eagle eyes or doesn’t drive using the app.  And now I have no way to roll back to the previous version.  So I’m stuck with a useless map program."

Google maps should absolutely not be able to change your route once you've already picked it at the beginning of our trip. We specifically chose a certain route to avoid a particular area, but because google maps thought it was quicker it automatically changed it when I wasn't looking. This is absolutely ridiculous and should not be allowed! I've always chosen google maps over any other service, but after this experience it barley gets a star in my book. This needs to be fixed!

I've gone 42 years without wearing glasses and to find out now that I need them was a little overwhelming. Dr Alicia was so thorough and took her time explaining everything to me step by step!!! She is an absolute sweetheart!!!  I also want to give a special thanks to amazing Esther for taking her time helping me find the right glasses for me.  She really knows what she is doing and found the most fabulous fit for me.  From 1 out of 10, I give them a 15!!! Thank you guys so much for all your help. I will always come back to you guys and send anyone I know!!!!!!"

It took me the most absurd way to my destination & took 3 times as long as it should have. And it couldn't figure out which road I was on and kept spazzing thinking I was exiting or on a different road next to the highway. It got me lost 3 times tonight again. Safe to say I will NEVER download this app again."
