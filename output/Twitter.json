In previous versions of the app, the trending article headlines would be read, out loud.

The current headline article will be displayed.  This area of the screen is VoiceOver accessible.  \n\n3.\nEither by single-finger swiping from left-to-right or using explore-by-touch, place VoiceOver focus on the “Trends for You” heading, located just above the middle center of the display.  \n\n4.\nNow, single-finger swipe from left-to-right in order to read the currently trending article headlines.  In previous versions of the app, the trending article headlines would be read, out loud.  Now, however, swiping from left-to-right results in nothing being read, out loud, even though there are trending article headlines being displayed on the screen.\n\nI fervently request that this VoiceOver accessibility bug be addressed as soon as possible.\n\nThank you,\n\nMark"

Go back to one week ago, please, to version 7.7 or 7.8. Seriously, the last bad update we had, I used to go back to version 6.31.5 (courtesy of downloading it from my Mac), and it was a huge improvement in functionality, despite the giant step backward. It was worth it. Now I can’t even do that anymore, thanks to the bloody update on my Mac! Also, scrolling back to the top of a thread is a hugely bad idea. If you want to make it so we can toggle between seeing the first tweet or the last, great. Give us the option. \n\n***\nOlder review (though still applicable): \n\nRevert the app to one week ago, and don't touch it. Now, it lags, has fits and coughs, and quits... It's such a pain. I hate guinea-pigging updates. We shouldn't have to delete and reinstall to reset the app for better functionality. \n\nI chain tweets together, and it's aggravating to be typing along...and have a lag. My fingers keep moving in the hopes that the app will catch up. It does, seconds later, when I should be already on my next tweet."

There has to be at least minimal effort on Twitter\\'s end to explicitly disclose accounts running of scripts or at least partially automated–include a blue \\'automated\\' badge next to usernames like the verified check. If removing the scripted accounts which make up 15%+ of Twitter is too much of a drop in user activity and scares investors then the very least Twitter can do is allow us to see which accounts are actually operated by real users."

The current headline article will be displayed.  This area of the screen is VoiceOver accessible.  \n\n3.\nEither by single-finger swiping from left-to-right or using explore-by-touch, place VoiceOver focus on the “Trends for You” heading, located just above the middle center of the display.  \n\n4.\nNow, single-finger swipe from left-to-right in order to read the currently trending article headlines.  In previous versions of the app, the trending article headlines would be read, out loud.  Now, however, swiping from left-to-right results in nothing being read, out loud, even though there are trending article headlines being displayed on the screen.\n\nThe only workaround, at this time, is for a VoiceOver user to continue swiping from left-to-right, until VoiceOver focus lands on the “Show More” button, the activation of which, will result in a VoiceOver accessible list of trending article headlines.  \n\nI fervently request that this VoiceOver accessibility bug be addressed as soon as possible.\n\nThank you,\n\nMark"

I have seen some vile things tweeted that stay up, while some other questionable content gets banned. They either need to, stop banning all together or be equal about banning speech. Finally, an ability to edit should have happened by now! The need to delete a tweet and then retweet, in order to fix a spelling or grammatical error, is asinine. Like Facebook, it can show the tweet has been edited, if they feel this is necessary."

But twitter unmutes my muted tweets & I’ve also noticed that when I retweet my own pinned tweet, twitter unpins my pinned tweet. A suggestion I have is to make twitter more fun by allowing us to change the color theme such as the colors of the sidebars, links & text on the username & bio. We are able to do this only on the web desktop version so far but on the twitter app we remain with the same boring blue color and it would be more fun to be able to pick a color that we want rather than having it blue all the time."

Opening a particular twitter user's page is more-not-less-clicks than it was in the previous update. Drafting a new tweet looks cartoon-like. Yuck.\n\nLastly, they make it harder to like Twitter with almost every update. Instead of fixing bugs, slimming down the updates, and making the app perform faster/better and more reliably, they add more-and-more bloat. I keep two Twitter-related apps on my iPhone: their website link, and a 3rd party Twitter app (no name, except it rhymes with Terrific). \n\nI fear Twitter has lost its way."

Just because it\\'s too much of a hassle to get rid of? No that can\\'t be the case because your constantly hiding INNOCENT PICTURES!!! Y\\'all have the time!! I\\'d like to not be traumatized by a woman covered in blood penetrating herself with a knife again please. \nAnd I also don\\'t like the idea of a favorite platform of mine promoting the industries that exploit, degrade, and objectify women. So I don\\'t see why you can\\'t just take down pornographic twitter profiles. Facebook does it. Hell, even Tumblr does a better job at hiding nsfw content. That\\'s saying A LOT."

This is far too sensitive and dismissing the bar when holding the iPad one handed is difficult. There was zero reason for this UI change.\n\nI'd also like an option to require a double-tap to drill down on a single tweet. While not horrible compared to some apps unintentional/misread taps happen often enough to allow this option. It's rare I view a single tweet, especially nowadays where few replies are ever actually shown and the few replies not completely hidden require additional taps to display.\n\n---\n\nTwitter's initial design and mission, free speech in SMS-size bites freely available for anyone to read based on their choice, was great. There were many great 3rd-party apps that have long since been shut down but the official app is mostly great, though it's shuffling of the timeline on refresh is annoying.\n\nThe two stars are for the service as things stand at the time of this writing: bans over language (particularly to \"verified\" accounts), missing replies (mostly because of Blocks which should never have been added, Mutes work within the initial design), encouraging \"reports\" of \"bad\" tweets over differing opinions, the service is a shell of its mission.\n\nTwitter wonders why growth is stalled. They think \"cleaning\" things up will work when instead it causes other users to use the service less and warn away new people. You either believe in freedom or you don't. Twitter launched claiming belief, today they represent stifling of speech."

Another disgusting thing Twitter does is soft censoring answers posted to President Trump's tweets to show only negative replies, while pushing down the positive ones. That's Twitter's sad failing attempts at changing the public's perspective. They continue to fail because we see you, Twitter. Often people are unable to retweet some of my tweets just because they represent conservative values."

After opening a graphic, a small white X appears in the upper left corner to close the graphic and return to the original tweet.\n\nHitting this X successfully seems to be an exercise in futility as it hardly ever works the first time. Not sure if the radius is too small or there\\'s another issue. But it needs to be fixed in the next update."

The only negative thing I have to say about the app is that the updates always seem to have major changes to them. Other than that, I'm so thankful for Twitter. It's changed my life more than I've ever realized."

I also like that twitter still keeps things in chronological order and doesn't force an AI on us. Because of this it has become my most used app, I even spend more time reading on twitter than I do watching videos or movies on YouTube or Netflix. Being able to easily click on a hashtag and easily find a place where people are only discussing that topic is great. A lot of the other social apps tend to have very cluttered hashtags so you don't always find what you're looking for. A suggestion would be to allow people to edit tweets even if it's only for a limited amount of time before the tweet becomes permanent. That way people aren't changing their tweets after a lot of people have seen it, but it still gives people the opportunity to fix typos."

It said to verify my phone number, so I did and then it asked for a code and called my number (which was at 2:00am) and woke my entire house up. It didn't even warn me that it was going to freaking call without my permission, which is obviously say no to. I should have gotten a warning to ask if they could freaking call my number at 2:00am and ask for a CODE. This would be a lot easier if it would ask for an email, which it didn't. Not to mention it didn't match me up with any of my interests. Picked things from art and lifestyle and the feed was politics? Stupid!!!!

They sure censor their negative and truthful reviews. \n\nAnd before anyone states these issues are due to operator error, I will say I\\'ve had this app for a long time.

The color white is boring. All colors should be available for people to use. So it should be a wide variety. We should also get to choose the colors. It would be cool if we could use Gifs or animated photos for picture profiles. This last suggestion may seem redundant. But I think Twitter could make a FaceTime feature."

I have a feeling that will disappear when the iPad layout becomes similar to the iPhone layout with the profile button disappearing once this functionality is working on the iPad version.\n\nVersion 7.0\n\nTBH, after reading all the reviews, I thought I'm going to hate the new version but I was wrong. Despite that I need to restart the app 2 times after the update but that doesn't bother me. The new layout works just fine on both my iPhone 6 & iPad Mini 4 and the profile button stayed on my iPad after the latest update.

This is ... incredibly inconvenient and I will not be able to use this app now because of it.

It works - I just can\\'t use it because its most basic of functions no longer meets my needs.\n\nWhy in the world would you (Twitter) encourage the use of lists and then arbitrarily decide on, one of your updates, to deny users access to some (any) of those lists? As a long time Twitter user this move is considered unwise, and discouraging to people who want to use your app.\n\nAnd now, I need to either find a new app or use the mobile site - which actually allows me to access all of my lists."

While I thoroughly enjoy the roller coaster of laughing, crying, being amazed by tweets, I prefer clean speech. I do question why Twitter removes some profane comments but not others.\n\nSomething annoying, I find, is to receive messages from those impersonating someone. One pastor has 7 fakes duplicating his twitter page!? The blue check mark system is helpful but not all Twitter accounts use the blue check mark. This issue is causing me to consider giving up on Twitter."

Rightly stands against the propagation of Sharia Law which is oppressing women & children worldwide. \n6. Seeks to set Slaves Free from sex industry, forced labor & child abuse. \n7. Insists Justice be served, even if an individual is connected, wealthy, well-known or has served USA in an official capacity. \n\nTwitter Team, you have a grave responsibility to humankind.

        "content": "Twitter is extremely biased against US President Donald Trump. Not even the userbase, but the company itself. Constantly censoring right-wing opinions, the designers of this app have opted to promote almost exclusively extreme leftist opinions in its new Buzzfeed copy: Twitter Moments. Two years ago when this feature was introduced, it was optional and nobody ever used it. I guess they caught on, because now instead of being able to search on any of the apps 4 tabs, you have to go to the one which has Twitter Moments on it in order to look anything up on the app. I wouldn\\'t have a problem with this, but often it is faked news. I\\'m not just throwing that term around either. Just yesterday they published an \\\"article\\\" about how President Trump apparently did not denounce white nationalists and neo-Nazis, and how reactions to that were \\\"mixed\\\". The problem with that, however, is that he actually did denounce those two hate groups, and Twitter refuses to retract this false headline. The people in charge of Twitter Moments are also known racists, with an article popping up every now and then about \\\"removing whites from Hollywood\\\" or \\\"what would your favorite tv shows be like if there were no white straight men?\\\" Seems a bit... bigoted... wouldn\\'t you say? This app would be much better, maybe one of the best if they stopped trying to constantly bow down to the left and at least put up an attempt to seem unbiased. Sadly though, they never have to since their actions have no consequences, since they have a monopoly on microblogging. Oh well!"

Also not a fan of any tech company censoring speech or misrepresenting data (trending, etc) based on the personal biases of owners. Of course private companies can do what they want - that's a big part of America's success - but if marketed as a platform for people to practice freedom of expression as set forth in the US Constitution under our First Amendment rights, then people should not be suspended for different opinions that don't involve any plots of death or other illegal activity. I do like that @ handles in replies no longer count toward space max; would be great if at least a \"grace\" number of spaces or handles were also allowed in new tweets."

They even save round and not square like the original photo your chose as your avi. You all need to stop giving us all this extra and unnecessary changes and GIVE US AN EDIT BUTTON. I need the option to revert back to an earlier version of the app. I've been on twitter since 2011 so I know what I want and what I hate."

It's a waste of time to even Check out what's trending. \n\nI also work long hours and when I check my Twitter feed I often find a box the asking if I'd like to see more tweets.  On either side of the tweets will be many hours apart.  While I appreciate the idea that I might not want to scroll thru all the tweets I missed, I find it frustrating that if I hit the box it takes me to a random place in my tweets.  I wish there was an option to stay or move forward.\n\nTwitter is s great place to keep in touch with news from my state to the world!"

And I have gotten tired of this. I have sprit, and good signal. Everything is fine but it continues to do this. So if I cannot find a solution to this I will have to stop using the app for my iPhone 6s. They don't really have many proper ways to contact them about this issue. Please if anyone else has this issue or knows what to do or any suggestions PLEASE LET ME KNOW! This is a great app that's why I'm leaving 4 stars. Honestly that's my only problem with the app is I cannot use it. Thanks."

Hopefully, competitors will evolve.\n\nOn another note, Twitter is far too lenient with its policies on advertising (promotion). Too many advertisements, and too much schilling by news media pretending to be reporting news when the article is nothing but an advertisement."

Twitter\\'s support bot isn\\'t useful at all.\n2. Have tweets in chronological order.\nThe timeline is all messed up for me and sometimes I don\\'t even see tweets from people I follow.\n3. Explain exactly what changes on the updates.\n\\\"Minor bug fixes and improvements\\\" do not justify a 200MB update. Explaining what got changed or what has been fixed will.\n4. Add an edit button.\nWhen a tweet gets made, the user should have five minutes to edit it so they don\\'t have to delete and make the tweet again.\n5. Increase the character limit to 200 characters \nThe amount of characters we have for each tweet (140) isn\\'t enough, having 200 would be much better.\n6. Stop shadowbanning people \nIf you need to ban someone, please tell them what they did wrong, how they can prevent it from happening in the future, and how long the ban will last.\n7. Have an option to turn off the \\\"What your friends\\\" like and the \\\"This tweet may contain sensitive content\\\" features.\nThey are both really annoying and don\\'t \\\"improve\\\" the Twitter experience at all.\n8. Bring back the old design \nThe only design made it much easier to have a square icon and it made it much easier to get to my profile.\nSo this is what I\\'d change on Twitter, if these get changed I\\'ll edit my review and adjust the rating accordingly, but for right now I give it a one-star rating."

The color white is boring. All colors should be available for people to use. So it should be a wide variety. We should also get to choose the colors. It would be cool if we could use Gifs or animated photos for picture profiles. This last suggestion may seem redundant. But I think Twitter could make a FaceTime feature."

HOWEVER, with that much influence in the world twitter does little to control the well known bots-fake accounts-it acknowledges are out there but counts among it's users. They have a responsibility to clean house or become the new, laughed at social media that people turn away from. So far I am still a fan."

It seems to be a really difficult concept for Twitter to just provide you with the tweets of those you follow, in chronological order, and not add content or change you place in the timeline or auto refresh and make you lose your place. Why?\n\nOther glaring problems: \n\n1/ You can\\'t unfollow someone without having to confirm every time. But you can follow them without having to confirm. Annoying.\n\n2/ Twitter has been around for what, ten years? And we still can\\'t mute someone for just a few hours (say, because we don\\'t care about that ball game they\\'re tweeting about). Nope. We have to mute them then remember to go back and UNMUTE them. So basic, but so broken. \n\n3/ Stop friggin forcing tweets into my timeline that aren\\'t from people that I follow. It\\'s really really intrusive. I don\\'t care if John and Sally \\\"liked\\\" Jim\\'s tweet. If I did, I\\'d let you know. \n\n4/ Stop with the \\\"in case you missed it\\\" summary. I\\'ve clicked \\\"see less often\\\" twenty times and disabled \\\"show me the best tweets first\\\" but you still seem to think I care if I missed someone\\'s tweet. I do not. \n\n5/ Basically, give us control over our timelines instead of passive-aggressively force-feeding us content we didn\\'t ask for."

I know it's the Twitter app it should because it does not happen with any other app or when I'm on the Internet. I can't speak for any security updates on this but I can say, feature wise,  I would NOT recommend this update."

They take away space from the current tweets & make it harder to see them. I liked being able to minimize these sections & choosing to not have them show up so much. Now, I can't do that. Please change this back.\n\nEdit: The \"In Case You Missed It\" section not only shows tweets that you might have missed, it also shows tweets that you might have already seen.\n\nEdit 2: I found out from one of the accounts that I tweet regularly that my tweets are not always showing up. I have to resend most of my tweets to that account. Is this because of the \"In Case You Missed It\" feature?\n\nEdit 3: For the \"Who to Follow\" feature, I don't want to see more. I want to see less or none at all.\n\nEdit 4: Thanks for taking care of the issue with the \"ICYMI\" feature. Now, can you please put my tweets through to another account's TL? As I stated earlier, the owner of the account has informed me that my tweets don't always show up on the TL, even though the account is always tagged in them. When they do show up, it's because the account is on & active. Please fix this. It's been like this for over a year.\n\nEdit 5: On my second account, I'm getting notifications from accounts that I don't follow. I have this option turned on so that I don't get notifications from accounts that I don't follow. Please fix this."

Nothing when someone likes or retweets content, but every single new tweet from someone I follow earns a big red notification alert -- best guess is this is how Twitter hopes to boost its stock price, by tricking OCD ushers into constantly opening the app to view ghost notifications when it\\'s just an add for soda."

Nonetheless, I hate it. \n\nI just wish that Donald Trump would download the update too. If he hated the update as much as I do, he might stop Tweeting. And the world would be a better place. \n\nTwitter said this was a \\\"minor\\\" update, so I updated. \n\nIn fact, it is an update that rearranges the interface. Most annoyingly, it has moved Lists around so that it is no longer possible to be reading a series of tweets from your lists, while reading your timeline and switch easily between the two. \n\nThat makes it much harder to organize what you\\'re reading instead of having to deal with Twitter\\'s algorithms ideas about what you want to read. \n\nTHIS UPDATE REALLY STINKS!!"

Please change this back.\n\nEdit: The \"In Case You Missed It\" section not only shows tweets that you might have missed, it also shows tweets that you might have already seen.\n\nEdit 2: I found out from one of the accounts that I tweet regularly that my tweets are not always showing up. I have to resend most of my tweets to that account. Is this because of the \"In Case You Missed It\" feature?\n\nEdit 3: For the \"Who to Follow\" feature, I don't want to see more. I want to see less or none at all.\n\nEdit 4: Thanks for taking care of the issue with the \"ICYMI\" feature. Now, can you please put my tweets through to another account's TL? As I stated earlier, the owner of the account has informed me that my tweets don't always show up on the TL, even though the account is always tagged in them. When they do show up, it's because the account is on & active. Please fix this. It's been like this for over a year.\n\nEdit 5: On my second account, I'm getting notifications from accounts that I don't follow. I have this option turned on so that I don't get notifications from accounts that I don't follow. Please fix this."

Please change this back.\n\nEdit: The \"In Case You Missed It\" section not only shows tweets that you might have missed, it also shows tweets that you might have already seen.\n\nEdit 2: I found out from one of the accounts that I tweet regularly that my tweets are not always showing up. I have to resend most of my tweets to that account. Is this because of the \"In Case You Missed It\" feature?\n\nEdit 3: For the \"Who to Follow\" feature, I don't want to see more. I want to see less or none at all.\n\nEdit 4: Thanks for taking care of the issue with the \"ICYMI\" feature. Now, can you please put my tweets through to another account's TL? As I stated earlier, the owner of the account has informed me that my tweets don't always show up on the TL, even though the account is always tagged in them.

Many of my friends have this problem as well as tons of people on line reporting this problem with no way to fix it. Twitter help center does nothing to help. I'm tired of opening my app and not being able to see anything my friends are tweeting because there's just tons of random accounts in my feed. It's ridiculous that this has not been fixed. Screw you twitter. No longer using your app as it is just a pain  and I can't even use it anyway as I can't view any tweets I actually care about. Fix it."

Twitter is getting back to being a good source of information presented in an actual timeline. I'm cautiously upgrading my rating of the current version to 3 stars and will continue to upgrade the closer the app gets back to being a true timeline. \n\nTwitter was always a good source to see things / events / news in a fairly accurate timeline. Its important in this day and age to see the latest topics and follow along chronologically. The latest update destroyed any possibility of that and now the \"ICYMI\" makes your feed impossible to read and you can't dismiss it. It will force Tweets into your feed from a wide variety of times that makes the feed impossible to follow. When you use Twitter to follow current news and topics, the new \"can't dismiss\" ICYMI breaks Twitter and turns it into a jigsaw puzzle. This is NOT what you want from a social media app. Please fix it Twitter\"\n\n7/24/2017 : The latest update changes nothing, ICYMI still jumbles the timeline, really breaking the purpose of the Twitter app. After years of happy use, my rating remains a 1 star.

Twitter needs to stream line its features and think how a user would when it wants to update. Right now a downgrade to less complications seems like a pretty good idea. Basically this app is like an infomercial, trying to fix problems that don't exist by making them harder.\n\nTwitter's organization system is definitely not new user friendly, either. At least give users the option to have tweets appear in the timeline chronologically instead of trying to calculate how likely it is a user has seen a post and also making sure they seen the most popular posts. That's how you drive new users out very easily.\n\nAnyone who has worked on those features was seriously overthinking it"

They basically guarantee there will be tweets you \\\"missed\\\" by pulling tweets\nout of your feed so that they ONLY appear in the ICYMI section. Of course, this means that these tweets are not only out of chronology now, but often they are lacking context provided by other tweets. There are hidden among Tweets yoy have already seen (if you read your entire feed as I do), and tweets you will see again after scrolling above the ICYMI section (how can I MISS a tweet I haven\\'t had the change to get to yet?).\n\nEven if they were to stop yanking tweets out of order for this section I don\\'t want to see, the problem remains that I don\\'t want this section and have no way to opt out (even theoretically opt out as with the \\\"show me less often\\\" option which seemed\nmore decorative than actually functional--I still saw things I opted to see less often quite often).\n\nI love Twitter, but this is ruining my experience. I am aggravated every time I see it, which is most times I check the app. Being infuriated several times a day is not an acceptable experience for me. If this isn\\'t changed soon, I will regrettably have to leave Twitter--I will miss it a lot, but it\\'s not worth the irritation caused by pointless and infuriating design changes."

Now, it's not unusual to see topics with nine tweets trending at number one(usually heavily towards one side of politics). It doesn't matter what side of the political isle you lean towards, we should all be outraged by FAKE trends. People being banned because they say one thing and others being applauded for saying the same thing but for the opposing side. I'm not very political but this is disgusting. \n\nThat is why I no longer tweet. I just check in to see what my favorite people are saying and check out. Twitter is supposed to be a place where EVERYONE has a voice. Regardless of what you believe in. \n\n1/5 stars."

A day or two after I updated twitter, I couldn\\'t see the entire video that I was watching because it was cropped horizontally which is why I could only see the bottom half of the video and ever since that day all of my video are like that. Please🙏🏻 fix it as soon as possible because its really frustrating. Another thing I want to mention is the edit button. Please add an edit button because its really frustrating when I make a single mistake while trying to tweet something and I have to delete the whole thing for that one mistake and do it properly all over again.\nI\\'m not pushing that much for the problems other than the video because you can deal with them, but the video problem is not one that you deal with and its just so frustrating.

        "content": "I\\'ve been using twitter for about 2 years now and it has worked fine, but for the past few weeks I\\'ve been having so many issues with it. First it constantly keeps crashing, mostly just out of nowhere, and when I open the app again it\\'s at a spot I was at like 10 minutes ago. Another issue I have is when I tap on a video the bottom half sometimes gets cut off for some reason, really annoying when a video has subtitles. ALSO, twitter is unliking some pictures I liked before! I swear I liked all of these pics and I went back to them, it says I didn\\'t like them. That\\'s pretty much all the issues I\\'ve been having recently but some other things that could be fixed: The timeline is a mess, it\\'s so out of order and the likes aren\\'t in order either which can be irritating. The feature where a video plays and after a bit it moves to the next video is annoying for me and kinda unnecessary. Also the profile button should be put back to the bottom so it can be more accessible. I don\\'t really have a problem with the circle icon tbh, but I really do wish you can zoom in and out when changing it.\n\nUPDATE: Another issue to add to the abundance of issues I\\'m experiencing, gifs aren\\'t loading unless I tap on them which it wasn\\'t like before. Also the gif is getting cropped now. Pls I just want a functioning app"

I have a screen shot where the same tweet is on screen twice, once in my feed and again in the \\\"ICYMI\\\" section. Pointless and I really don\\'t even enjoy using the app anymore.

I really regret updating the app. Also with update 7.3.2 the app continually crashes. \n\nUpdate: I can no longer tweet from the app, i'm supposedly \"following nobody at this time\" and tweets aren't loading.

Another issue I have is when I tap on a video the bottom half sometimes gets cut off for some reason, really annoying when a video has subtitles. ALSO, twitter is unliking some pictures I liked before! I swear I liked all of these pics and I went back to them, it says I didn't like them. That's pretty much all the issues I've been having recently but some other things that could be fixed: The timeline is a mess, it's so out of order and the likes aren't in order either which can be irritating. Also the feature where a video plays and after a bit it moves to the next video is annoying for me and kinda unnecessary."

Within the past few days, \\\"in case you missed it\\\" tweets, which used to be a thing I could dismiss, have now become mandatory for me to see. And most of the time, they\\'re tweets I already have seen. If they\\'re not, Twitter often chooses to pull a random tweet out of a thread someone wrote, so what I see there makes no sense... and then when I scroll through my timeline to find the rest of the thread, that one tweet is absent, because it was in the ICYMI section. It\\'s incredibly annoying. I HATE it. I want to be able to dismiss the ICYMI section again. Did I mention that I hate it?\n\nAnother thing I don\\'t like is being forced to see tweets that I don\\'t follow because someone I do follow liked the tweet. Often, I know who the person in question is, and I don\\'t follow them for a reason. I do not want to be forced to see tweets from people I don\\'t follow. \n\nIt\\'s bizarre that neither of these things affect me when I use Twitter from my computer-- only the app. It\\'s making me want to delete the app and only use Twitter from my computer at home. That\\'s how much I hate it."

I don't need recommendations for that, I know who I want to follow and who I do not want to follow.\n\nI didn't miss any tweets. If I didn't see a tweet because I wasn't logged in, that's fine, I don't need to see it!! Don't put it further up on my timeline because I wasn't logged in 8 hours ago!! I use twitter to see what's happening IN THE MOMENT. So what good does it do for me that someone tweeted about a topic 13 hours ago and I'm seeing it now. ENOUGH.\n\n2. As someone who uses several different profiles, it is so frustratingly annoying to click the current profile icon, wait for the menu to slide, click an incredibly small sized profile button, wait for the menu to slide, then have to slide the menu over again, and THEN click the current profile's icon in order to see what the latest activity is on this profile before deciding your next move. Even if I just had one profile this format would be frustrating. I just want to glance at my profile to see the latest activity (I.e. Have I tweeted recently? How well is my latest tweet doing? Should I wait for it to slow down before my next? Etc.) This format is so time consuming for a method that should be quick since the usual goal is just a short glance.\n\nI've never written a review for any app before this, so that should tell you how strongly I feel about this, as well as many others."

I also don\\'t like how they added a sidebar that we have to open in order to view our profile. The new look isn\\'t great on the app to me as well. I really regret updating the app. Also with update 7.3.2 the app continually crashes. Twitter, you really should go back to the previous version before the big change. \n\nUpdate: I can no longer tweet from the app, i\\'m supposedly \\\"following nobody at this time\\\" and tweets aren\\'t loading. Its not a problem with my connection or service because all my other apps work. Twitter is just not working. Edit: My account was locked for no reason, and I finally have it back."

It\\'s stupid to have to slide to the right and click on \\\"profile\\\" just to be able to see your own tweets, favorites, etc. There was literally not one thing wrong with the way it was before. It was faster and better. If I\\'m reading a conversation and want to chime in or respond, I know have no way of getting to my own profile without leaving the conversation that I currently have up. Before the pointless update I could easily just cloak my profile in the dock and  see everything I\\'d written or favorited, etc. Now the only way to do that is by leaving what you\\'re currently reading/viewing, which isn\\'t even worth it since you won\\'t be able to pick back up where you left off. The new update makes people not even try to communicate with each other for fear of losing where they were in a conversation or thread. It\\'s also tedious, annoying, and unnecessary. \n\nIf anything you should have to swipe right to access your DM\\'s, not your own profile. That would\\'ve been a much smarter move. But the way you have it now makes people hate using the app because again, it\\'s tedious, annoying, and unnecessary."

Now they seem like a whole row between tweets (rather than an extension of a tweet), especially because they're so close to the line that separates tweets. \n\nAlso, the avatars are too large and the names of the people I follow are too small. With as many people as I follow, and as often as they change their avatars, I don't rely on their avatars to see who wrote a tweet, but rather their name. Also, needs more visual space between user name and tweet... the two run together and it makes reading the actual tweet not difficult!\n\nC'mon guys, I thought the goal of updates is to make things better. Don't make a visual changes just for the sake of change, unless you're actually going to make things better!\n\nPass these notes along to your UX/UI people and tell them they can do a better job than this."

I'll get through some of my timeline, then the app freezes for a couple of seconds, then I find myself back at my iPad's home screen. I go back into the app, and my timeline is back where I first started from, making me reload the tweets I've already read to get to the new tweets I haven't.\n\nAlso, the translation feature isn't working anymore. I follow a few Japanese and eastern Asian people, and the translation feature is very handy. Another thing to be debugged.\n\nI'm starting to look for replacements for the official Twitter app, but I would prefer if this app was fixed."

Now, when I open the app, it jumps to the newest tweet first, and when I scroll down, there's a bar to show me the last tweets I viewed. \n\nAdditionally, after a long time of being able to dismiss features I didn't like (\"in case you missed it\" for example), this is now a permanent feature that also reorders my timeline while I'm sleeping. If you're going to make something a permanent feature, don't give me a choice to submit my feedback against it for two years first. \n\nI'd like to be able to choose for myself which way I want to scroll through my timeline, thank you very much. I don't mind the bar telling me what I last viewed, but I don't like having to scroll through everything new to find it. I think it is way more attractive to have infinite customizable options, rather than forcing everyone to adjust to one method every new update."

        "rating": 1.0, 
        "title": "Latest design update turned me from a Twitter LOVER/avid user to disgusted/reluctant user & avoider", 
        "content": "I manage 10 professional Twitter accounts and two personal accounts, with more than 45,000 followers, and have been on Twitter for eight years. Over those years Twitter has been getting better and better and I have become a more avid and happy user all the time. UNTIL THIS MOST RECENT DESIGN UPDATE, WHICH IS ATROCIOUS.\n\nI haven't rated an app or written a review in about two years, but this design update is so horrible I felt compelled to go out of my way to let Twitter know just how horrifically bad it is, how much it ruins my user experience, and how much it makes me hate Twitter and my iPad Twitter app, both of which I used to LOVE and use constantly.\n\n---------- \n\nNEW DESIGN ISSUES: \n(Just a few of the many, but I don't have all day to write this review.)\n\n1) The round user icons are terrible. 10 out of the 12 accounts I manage have text on their icons that was created for SQUARE icons. Now the text cannot be fully read, as the round icons cut it off on the four corners. So now I have to redo 10 icons and squeeze all of the text into a smaller space so it can hopefully be seen and no longer cut off. (Or leave the icons with unreadable, cut off, and confusing, text, as they are now.) Thanks Twitter! :-(\n\n2) The new options below a tweet are confusing and annoying. The \"reply\" option looks like a thought bubble or a quote indication. It does not in any way indicate \"replies.\" I feel like if I click on it I should see all of the quotes of the tweet.\n\n3) The tweets that are replies to other tweets now more prominently display who they are replying to above the tweet in a bigger sized font, which looks like it is now part of the tweet, and is distracting from the ACTUAL tweet. Also there is now less contrast in the color between the text of who the tweet is replying to and the tweet text itself, making it all turn into one big confusing blob of unreadable text. Please fix this!\n\n4) You changed the color scheme or schemes that I was using, and the new colors look awful, and the app doesn't seem to provide any way of changing them back.\n\n5) The new color scheme has less of a contrast between the text of a tweet and the links and hashtags than previously. This leads to them all blending into each other and all looking like a big unreadable blob, instead of previously, when you could clearly see the text as different from the hashtags and links. Extremely annoying and non-user friendly! \n\n6) The new \"thin line\"  design of the settings icon and other icons that are no longer solid, are just copying other designs from other companies which I hate, and they look ugly and annoying. One of the reasons I liked Twitter was because the design WASN'T like those others that use that horrible design. Now you just look like conformists who don't care about good design, but instead just follow the herd and use an ugly design just because others do. Pathetic.\n\n7) So many things I click on in the app are now all jerky and bounce around the screen. Very annoying.\n\n---------- \n\nOTHER ISSUES:\n(Only a couple of the many, because of limited time and energy to deal with this.)\n\n1) There is still no way to see only the QUOTE TWEETS of a tweet, whether one's own tweet or another's tweet. In the notifications there is only the ALL or MENTIONS. The MENTIONS used to include quote tweets, but that useful feature was removed. Please either put the quote tweets back into replies/mentions, or create a separate tab in the notifications for quote tweets. That will allow a user to see who quoted their own tweets more easily. But that still won't allow someone to see who quoted OTHER people's tweets. So please provide an option below any tweet, to see who QUOTED that tweet. \n\n2) On iOS for iPad, there seems to be no way to reverse the design to the previous one, or go back to a previous version of the app. If there is I've missed it, so please inform me if I am incorrect about this. Thanks.\n\n---------- \n\nTwitter might wonder, \"What about all those great new options that we added? Why aren't you acknowledging THEM and don't you appreciate them?\" NO. None of them matter to me at all or improve my user experience in any way.\n\nI could have spent all the time writing this review using Twitter itself, which is what I would have usually been doing during this time. But because the UI design is now so bad, I've now switched to complaining about Twitter, and reading others' complaints about Twitter (as therapy to deal with my rage, disappointment and upset), instead of actually using Twitter. \n\nHopefully Twitter will listen to the feedback of their users who used to love them, and change back the design, or at least change it to something that isn't horrifically bad and so very non-user-friendly. :-("

This is a major fix that needs to happen as well."

My mind emphasized feeling like it dehumanized us. \nGrowing up in a town named Ayotla (93-2001) it wasn't strange for houses not to have access to a phone. Because of this it forced us, no, it enabled us to go out if we wanted to communicate and inform ourselves... Based on this is why I had the perspective of annoyance towards social media.\n\nFor a long time, I kept that perspective. That is, until my brother Frito, really introduced me to Twitter! \n\nIt's been a little over a year now (I remember getting an anniversary notification not to long ago) and all I can say after all this time is that, I love it. It works for me because it allows me to inform and communicate without any of the nuisances that most social media seem to have. \n\nIf you feel or felt like that at one point in your life... Tweet."

It\\'s great for following newspaper publishers and government agencies, and it\\'s a great way to keep in touch with what is important to you."

        "content": "(7-17/17)\nCrashes all the time when viewing images. Memory overrun on normal use.\nVery poor image render speed.\n\nV. 6.25.1\nWorks quite well but it is confusing on Twitter's purpose as a social platform for IOS now that the Discover and Activity functions are gone from this release. It is very annoying not seeing friend activity to find new people to follow and chat with.\nOnly one true issue is that the new boxes (shared information within the tweet) look like the styling was not finished on them. The spacing/padding needs to be tightened and it needs to have a little more clean UI look like the rest of the app.\n\nV. 6.16.1\nWorking good except for crashing (or send error) when trying to send a tweet with an image that was captured with burst mode. \n\nVersion 6.13.3:\nSuuuuuuuper buggy. Starting to look like it was not bug tested fully on this latest release before it was published.\n- Image rotation is broken when viewing images\n- Notifications are super flaky\n- App badges are acting up and do not associate with what it should show in the app.\n\nVersion 5.1.3 review:\nThe app is incredibly slow to launch on an iPhone 5. The allow others to DM you was a nice opt-in feature before you just disabled it.\nThe fonts used between digest view and single view are not even remotely the same.\nThe location nag on every new twitter post is so incredibly annoying.\nOther than those obvious issues, it is looking a little more polished.\n\nVersion 5.0.2 review:\nConversations within clicking on a tweet are still broken. Mobile twitter website is working better than the app :-/\n\nVersion 5.0.1 review:\nJust as the app was getting to be a great app, here came another update and made it unusable again.\nThe timeline is jacked. Tweets show up all over the timeline without any coherent sorting.\nWhen you open a tweet that is part of a conversation, 90% of the time none of the other  tweets within the conversation show up.\nSometimes refreshing the timeline on 3G or 4G can be sufferingly slow. \nIt is hit an miss whether you will see an image without having to click on the link within the tweet.\n\nOther than those problems (which is pretty much the entire functionality bit) it operates ok :-/\n\nVersion 3.0 review:\nI am not sure what happened to the quality of this app. The previous version (v3..) was amazing!\nNow for what's wrong:\nInstapaper no longer works or is even evident of how to use. Swipe to reply is no longer there. Translations is a pain because it is GONE. The discover icon is almost as cluttered as a Microsoft word toolbar. The fact that you can only add one picture now per tweet is very annoying. The fact that the web interface lets you view conversations but the iPhone app does not - leads me to believe that this app was rushed to deployment.\nOverall,\nThe new look is nice visually but on the functionality end compared to previous versions is very lacking."

Stop doing it to yourself \n\nHow about you listen when I report an ad as not relevant. I'm a single middle aged woman who doesn't have cable, your Nickelodeon ads really are wasted on me. Since you won't listen, I've taken to blocking the accounts. \n\nTwitter is better when it doesn't try to be like Facebook.

No enemy from the outside is strong enough to do\nIt, it will be by our own stupidity, ignorance and arrogance that will bring us down.   Americans will do it. No foreign governments have the balls to do it, however we have the sheer stupidity to let it happen. It\\'s as if we just don\\'t care anymore ❣️. \n\\\"Our country may not be perfect but I\\'ll hold her hand until she is❣️\\\". That is why I love the Tweetie bird just so I can see what ignorance and stupidity really looks like. \n\\\"Ignorance can be fixed stupid is forever\\\"\n\nFriendships are being destroyed over the differing of opinions.  People scream FREE SPEECH, but do they really understand what it truly means. I love my country and will fight for her until I die.  WAKE UP AMERICA, WAKE UP❣️❣️. GOD BLESS AMERICA ❣️❣️🇺🇸🇺🇸\n\nAs to politicians I wouldn\\'t believe them even if their tongues came notarized.  \n\nHow\\'s this for a review???"

I recently posted on several comment of Linda Sarsour\\'s and within a few hours I was censored and shut down for typing the word Jackass or f**king. I have never in any way, shape or form threatened, harassed or in any way hurt anybody in like or online. Every single day Twitter allows posts that Are extremely egregious, such as THREE BEHEADED CHILDREN IN a post just last week, Iman\\'s issuing calls to kill Anybody and everybody that aren\\'t Muslim, and the list could go on and on. If a call for jihad against the President of the United States by an ungrateful Immigrant, Racist like Linda Sarsour doesn\\'t get Twitters attention as well as censored I\\'m not sure anybody in your camp has the ability to be objective. Twitter has become and IS a social media for Liberal propaganda and extremely fake news. I no longer enjoy anything about it. If Twitter can not and will not be OBJECTIVE AND FAIR they need to advertise as such."

Using customer feedback in this version, it is really improved. The Twitter app is back to being my main client. \n\nNice QOL additions added! Swipe back from link and Safari view controller were the two features I wish this app had. Now they are added! The Twitter team also made the app more fluid and polished. Everything works and looks great!\n\nThe only request I have left would be an option to disable all ads via an IAP, low monthly subscription maybe? I would gladly pay $1.99 per month to not have to see promoted tweets. As of now, I block these accounts. This is quite annoying to have to do every 8-10 tweets. Please follow the Reddit app and add a way to remove these ads. \n\nThanks very much for all the improvements. Much appreciated!"

It's a waste of my time. I hate those messages. They are like \"Thanks for following me...check out this link\" like no, I don't want to check out that link thank you very much. Anyways rant over.

Now it\\'s much more difficult because it makes you open the app up from where you were, massively slowing down the process to respond - with the effect now of not wanting to respond at all when I get notifications. AND it erases all other notifications (that I want to go back to later) when you go to just ONE to respond- which REALLY makes me frustrated when I have to stay in the original app I was using. One other area of improvement would be to lessen the number of steps it takes to get to my profile, followers, etc. with the new updates, much more cumbersome."

I appreciate the aspect of twitter that gives a platform to free speech, however a condensed, ignorant, and snarky version of free speech it usually turns out to be. That said, I\\'m proud to give my opinion here, and I think it\\'s a stupid app overall, adding to many pathetic people\\'s stress levels and hatred levels against fellow Americans just like themselves. I could ignore all these people but twitter is always putting up hashtags and \\\"articles\\\", collections of tweets chosen for their liberalness and sheer ignorance which highlight and remind me of all my depressed, manic fellow twitter users.

These are things we've been complaining about and trying to get our voices heard forever. It'd be different if the technology was there yet but other apps have it so it's completely feasible specially in 2017. Twitter you need to show other social platforms that you're a force not to be reckoned with, which means giving the consumers what they want to keep them happy & forever using your service otherwise you'll be looking at a shift in platforms by people."

In this last update, they fixed the New Tweet bug that kept it crashing but now RTs don\\'t work--pity.\n\nNext, for the iPhone itself, the interface was always a little clunky but the new \\\"interface\\\" they\\'ve rolled out is very basic, muted, and in some ways user-hostile. Opening a particular twitter user\\'s page is more-not-less-clicks than it was in the previous update. Drafting a new tweet looks cartoon-like. Yuck.\n\nLastly, they make it harder to like Twitter with almost every update. Instead of fixing bugs, slimming down the updates, and making the app perform faster/better and more reliably, they add more-and-more bloat. I keep two Twitter-related apps on my iPhone: their website link, and a 3rd party Twitter app (no name, except it rhymes with Terrific). \n\nI fear Twitter has lost its way."

Now it won't load anything again and it's giving me an error message. \n\" ERROR\nAn error occurred. Please try again later. (The operation couldn't be completed.

I read the twitter rules and i had violated none! I appealed to that silly support only to get the same email back \"your account is suspended due to Twitter rule violation\"  I checked 10 million times for those violations and I couldn't find any..  There is no real support!  Automated email, with the same answer! A lie in my case because no one bothered to check if i have violated rules.  Now,  Im on my 3rd account and im constantly being asked to verify my phone number!  i dont want to give Twitter my phone number! This is my personal private number out there for hackers to obtain.  You have no rights to demand my phone number!  With that number comes many more personal and private information!  Im in a process of getting attorney's advice!  Whats next my SSN!  The moment i RT @realdonaldtrump the biggest bully on social media, i have to change accounts because I will not provide Twitter with my phone number! No! What about my 1st amendment right and \"freedom of speech\" Now i hate twitter. All it does it gives me headache."

        "content": "yeah i never leave reviews for apps and i've never left a review for twitter bc its usually a good experience but after the new update i decided to write one. first off, the circles are ugly. they aren't \"simple\" or cute they're just ugly and no one likes them. second off the fade over the header makes it look weird when you try to use a white header. no one wants to see the date a person joined thats just embarrassing and ugly. also, you really need to make it to where people can download gifs and images easily because thats becoming a huge issue. another problem is that all videos are BLURRY. even if i were to upload a 720p video it still uploads to a blurrier version and it makes me want to rip my hair out. another issue, MAKE AN EDIT TWEET BUTTON. you really don't understand how frustrating it is to see a typo in a tweet you've posted and you really want to edit the tweet instead of having to delete it and retype it all over again. ANOTHER PROBLEM is that its really hard to tweet something important all in 140 characters. thats just cruel. and one of everyones biggest issues is the fact that you delete saved accounts that people keep to save @'s but you wont delete accounts that haven't been used since 2010. i really think u should look into this issue because its a big one. you should also stop shadowbanning people for swearing and start suspending accounts that use slurs against lgbtq+ communities, women, and people of color so that the twitter environment is safer. twitter has always been a place where i can make friends and connect with more people but i also like to have a nice layout and look while using the app and the update really ruined a lot. like you really updated the app just for the look but you didnt fix any of the issues that people have been asking you to fix FOR SO LONG. please look into these issues."

I low key despise the bubble shaped pictures, literally no need for that, but the interface is nice and I\\'m still enjoying the heck out of night mode. I love seeing the RT and like button counter in tweets in live time.  twitter can we please get an edit tweet button already? Sheesh! Lol anywho. App is easy to use.. when they do have bugs it\\'s literally happening to everyone at once and u just have to tweet through it. 4 stars until we get our edit tweet button haha"

Overall, it doesn't improve twitter at all- in fact it makes it more complicated. It doesn't even look any more aesthetically pleasing. The update is useless."

I am disgusted to see how many racist and fake bots allowed to use this \"social media\" for political gain, Twitter has became the #1 source for Donald Trump to spew lies and hatred never in my life have I seen a leader act in this manner ,so much so it is putting the United States in jeopardy with its allies.

So, effectively, all Twitter needs to do is to allow the new streamline UI to be the default interface when VoiceOver is running, at launch.\n\nPlease join me in requesting that the new streamline UI be the default interface when VoiceOver is enabled.\n\nThank you,\n\nMark"

I can, however, see all of the members in a list when using a web browser.\n\nI believe this is a bug that I request be addressed ASAP.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1.\nFrom within the Twitter for iOS Mobile app, select the “Me” tab.\n\n2.\nSelect Settings and Privacy.  A list of options will appear.\n\n3.\nSelect Lists\n\n4.\nSelect a created list consisting of more than 20 members.  In my case, I selected one such list that has 60 members.\n\n5.\nNear the top of the display, select the “Members” tab.\n\nNow, a list of Twitter accounts will be displayed.  I can only see 20 accounts of the total 60.\n\nAnother issue I wish to address is that when VoiceOver, Apple’s software screen reading solution for the blind and low vision is enabled with the iOS Twitter app, when viewing quoted tweets, only the new text of the tweet can be read by VoiceOver.  The original text of the quoted tweet is simply spoken as “button.”  \n\nWhile the VoiceOver-user can activate this button, in order to be taken to the original tweet, where it can be read by VoiceOver, there is no prompt indicating this functionality.  \n\nI respectfully suggest that either (1) VoiceOver access to the original tweeted-text button be fixed so that it will be read, automatically or (2) instead of VoiceOver merely saying the word “button”, it be updated to say something like, “original tweet, button.”\n\nThank you,\n\nMark"

        "title": "Terrible New Look", 
        "content": "Twitter recently announced a new look for their app, which they say is \"simpler\" and \"looks better\" but is actually the opposite of both. Common tasks take more steps now than they used to, the UI is primitive and ugly, and it has dramatically decreased my interest in the platform in the course of less than 48 hours. It makes using the app more complicated and less fun… especially when you have multiple accounts added to the app that you frequently switch between. If the sidebar was removed on iPhone and it ran the way it does on iPad (with a profile tab, the way it used to be) it would at least be tolerable… but that's not the case. Way to go, Twitter. *slow clap*\n\nIn other, older news: the annoying \"Explore\" tab is still here and hasn't gotten any better. Twitter attracts all kinds of users; Personally, I don't care about 90% of what ANY social app puts in their \"Explore\" section… for example, Instagram's \"Explore\" tab is full of accounts fishing for likes and reposting other people's content, which I am not interested in and leads me to roll my eyes every time I go to search for something in the search bar that shares that page. Now Twitter is doing the same thing: not only is search moving from its nice place in the upper right, but it's taking up a tab on the TabBar and is just full of Tweets that I have zero interest in. I'd rather just have search separate from that tab and have the option to disable this new \"Explore\" tab because it is of zero use to me aside from the fact that it is now where search resides.\n\nTwitter as a service is awesome, and is my favorite social network which I believe is drastically underrated. I hope they fix the horrible changes they've been making lately, or they're only going to worsen their condition! I have an older version of the app on my computer, which I may just sync over to do away with this terrible new UI as long as I can still use Twitter. That's how bad it is.\n\nTip for users with multiple accounts: on iPhone (or iPod touch) you can switch accounts in one step by tapping and holding on your profile picture in the upper left. This isn't exactly the most intuitive shortcut ever, but it's at least better than the usual method. If possible, I recommend using this app on an iPad instead."

I finally made the decision to fully switch to the official twitter app and I'm very pleased. The UI is nice, it's easy to follow conversations/threads, and I like how I'm now able to easily switch between multiple accounts. \n\nA few suggestions for improvement to make this a 5-star app:\n\n- make it easier to switch night mode on and off. I use both modes and would love to have a simple gesture or action on the screen that allows me to make this switch. \n\n- show tweets in chronological order! \n\n- give users a paid option to remove ads. I'm completely happy paying for a nice app that also allows me to remove annoying ads, as I think are many users.\n\nEdit: Thank you for adding the ability to switch night mode on and off so easily! Love it! Overall, this really is the best option for Twitter if you're a heavy Twitter user."

        "content": "Twitter recently announced a new look for their app, which they say is \"simpler\" and \"looks better\" but is actually the opposite of both. Common tasks take more steps now than they used to, the UI is primitive and ugly, and it has dramatically decreased my interest in the platform in the course of less than 48 hours. It makes using the app more complicated and less fun… especially when you have multiple accounts added to the app that you frequently switch between. Way to go, Twitter. *slow clap*\n\nIn other, older news: the annoying \"Explore\" tab is still here and hasn't gotten any better. Twitter attracts all kinds of users; Personally, I don't care about 90% of what ANY social app puts in their \"Explore\" section… for example, Instagram's \"Explore\" tab is full of accounts fishing for likes and reposting other people's content, which I am not interested in and leads me to roll my eyes every time I go to search for something in the search bar that shares that page. Now Twitter is doing the same thing: not only is search moving from its nice place in the upper right, but it's taking up a tab on the TabBar and is just full of Tweets that I have zero interest in. I'd rather just have search separate from that tab and have the option to disable this new \"Explore\" tab because it is of zero use to me aside from the fact that it is now where search resides.\n\nTwitter as a service is awesome, and is my favorite social network which I believe is drastically underrated. I hope they fix the horrible changes they've been making lately, or they're only going to worsen their condition! I have an older version of the app on my computer, which I may just sync over to do away with this terrible new UI as long as I can still use Twitter. That's how bad it is."

Personally, I don't care about 90% of what ANY social app puts in their \"Explore\" section… for example, Instagram's \"Explore\" tab is full of accounts fishing for likes and reposting other people's content, which I am not interested in and leads me to roll my eyes every time I go to search for something in the search bar that shares that page.\n\nNow Twitter is doing the same thing: not only is search moving from its nice place in the upper right, but it's taking up a tab on the TabBar and is just full of Tweets that I have zero interest in. I'd rather just have search separate from that tab and have the option to disable this new \"Explore\" tab because it is of zero use to me aside from the fact that it is now where search resides.\n\nOh, and the new redesign that is meant to simplify things just makes most tasks more complicated; especially if you have multiple accounts in the app to switch between, which had a super-simple shortcut before that you can't use anymore."

When I typed in my current password it did not want to accept it. When clicking the link to reset and change my password, I was able to reset my password associated with my current username, but it still would not allow me to access Twitter.\nWill I ever be able to access Twitter??"

        "content": "This new update is absolutely horrible.  If Twitter was trying to make it LESS user-friendly & MUCH slower, they did an awesome job! It's incredibly slow when you try to look at articles & photos in someone's tweet. The \"new\" look is a step backwards in my opinion. Also, every time I'm scrolling through my feed it pulls open the profile page over and over again but when I purposely try to open the profile page, it won't open. It's very frustrating & a huge waste of my time. I also don't like the look of the circular profile pictures. This is just a bad update all the way around. I might have to stop using Twitter if it isn't changed back. Disappointing!!!"

        "content": "I had multiple accounts logged into my twitter app. I deactivated a few of them and they are no-longer accessible. Then, somehow my app disappeared. So, I downloaded twitter again. Whenever I click the app to begin using twitter, it AUTOMATICALLY tries signing me into an account that I cannot sign into anymore. It asks for a password, one I cannot provide. I tried deleting and re downloading 3 times, still somehow tries to sign me into my old inaccessible accounts. I still can't use twitter, I haven't been able to for over a week now. I can't even use twitter in safari because it automatically goes to the app, which doesn't work at all for me. Hopefully a update will release soon, one that doesn't try to sign people in to specific accounts, after re-downloading. I don't want twitter to \"assume\" who downloaded the app. Just let me sign into the app myself, so this doesn't ever happen."

My phone will just randomly restart. Over and over. I did all sorts of stuff and it only happened when I was on twitter or when it dies happen randomly when the phone comes back on as twitter loads it shuts down. It still happens about twice a week. I don't know if it's the phone or twitter ? I reinstalled and all that but still nothing happens until I open twitter. I guess we will see with the next IOS update. So the APP itself I think is fine as far as using        it( cover photo should be able to be bigger) I do think Twitter though should somehow develop a way to find fake accounts n delete them. There is WAY too many fake accounts for advertising and random stuff. So many duplicates. Gotta clean it up somehow. Plus some cool twitter handles are being taken."

I really have not used it for anything other than politics, but perhaps I will venture to other areas one day. I really like this app and look forward to exploring the many features it has. I\\'m a fairly new user and like all of the current features, but i understand things can always change. So until that time comes I\\'m totally enjoying my experience now."

        "content": "The new twitter update takes things that were once hyperlinked like usernames and makes them the redundant. I now have to swipe and click more in order to switch between accounts and I find my app glitching and accidentally switching between accounts - not great considering one is for work and another is for play. Please get rid of these changes and reassign whoever allowed them to come to pass. I am legitimately using your app more infrequently because of it."
