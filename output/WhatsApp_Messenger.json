        "content": "WhatsApp was first and foremost built to be a cross-platform messaging app. It's classic, easy to use and not overly complicated and THAT's the reason it's so popular, the reason people use it.\n I try to understand Facebook bringing their Snapchat story clone into every single app they own, but WhatsApp isn't like FB or Instagram. People use it to chat with friends and family, either one-on-one or in group chats. It doesn't belong here and most certainly isn't worth taking 2 actually convenient tabs away for Status and Camera, which could very well be put together into one. \nThe thing about Status is that absolutely no one uses it because there's already so many out there doing the same that were BUILT to do it. WhatsApp isn't. I give it two stars because at least they made a U-turn on text statuses, now just get rid of the 24-hour feature. \nYou put out good updates bringing good additions in the past, video calling just to name one. This isn't people rejecting change, it's people knowing the heart of WhatsApp and what it does best, the reason it's sitting at the top. They don't want yet another social network (especially not in a messaging app) doing the exact same thing. And the reason I among my many friends keep using it is to stay in touch, not to view each other's stories. \nDespite the horrible and unneccessary update, I am grateful for the messaging part of the app and the way it functions. Please focus on that."

        "content": "The idea of not having user names and associating your identity with your phone number was a brilliant, almost genius one which I guess required a lot of cool engineering in the backend. I think that's why Whatsapp's user base is the ginormous number of users that it is today. The ability to set privacy preferences was good. Photo & video sharing, audio calling, video calling which came later kept it a compelling application. Cool features like a desktop version of the application makes it nice to use. Automated chat backups on iCloud make it very useful. Secure messaging is welcome. Group messaging is awesome but was confusing earlier when the ability to reply to individual messages was not there. It can still be annoying when you get added to groups without your permission. Default auto-download settings should be 'off'. I hope stickers are on the way soon. Ability to view timeline of chat history and scroll to a particular point in time is sorely missing. A minor feature that would be welcome would be the ability to search individual chat histories. The application did go back to weird state a couple of times for me recently and it kept my chat history but lost all my settings which was very annoying. The new 24 hour status feature which I hear is copied seems useless."

You can‚Äôt remove people from ‚Äúrecently contacted‚Äù or ‚Äúfrequently contacted‚Äù prompts around iOS for sharing. I‚Äôm terrified I will send my girlfriends brother something immodest because his name shows above hers even though our chat volumes are way different.\n\nWhatsApp is a globally loved tool but has some pretty strange UX issues given its financial backer and experienced staff.

It's free and there is no dumb \"well the app is free but you have to pay for extra stuff\" it's COMPLETELY FREE. I'm able to see when the text delivered, when the other person saw it and if it's a voice message then when they listened to it. You can also replay voice messages. You can also do stories on it like snapchat which is kinda cool. Over all it's really great, it doesn't have glitches and it isn't slow. I 100% would recommend"

A \"select mode\" available from the start once I decide to share media would make the process much more convenient. \n- Please add an option for \"tap to record\" voice notes instead of hold to record."

The catch is these messages can only be sent to other smartphone users who also have WhatsApp. Once you install the app, it checks your address book to see if anyone else you know is already using WhatsApp and connects you automatically. The app also suggests allowing messages to be sent from your phone to those in your address book who aren't yet using WhatsApp, encouraging them to sign up. WhatsApp's license agreement requires users to be age 16 or older. In terms of questionable content, it's completely up to the user, but location-sharing capabilities make this app most appropriate for older teens. As of 2016 WhatsApp shares data with parent company Facebook; though users can opt out of some of the data sharing for a limited time, they can't completely opt out. Read the app's privacy policy to find out more about the types of information collected and shared.\n\nUSER REVIEWS"

Yes, I can just not take the call, but a smarter, more user-friendly feature would be preferred. The status tab was also a mistake that, as of yet, the developers refuse to unwind. Not a single contact of mine uses it. It's not what chat apps are for. Better muting of notifications would also be good. If I mute a thread, I want nothing at all from it till the mute expires: no notifications, no badge icons, no unarchiving. Finally, the periodic verification requests for two-step authentication are annoying and inconsistent with my expectations for how the feature should work and with the way I've seen any other app implement this. They're so annoying, that they could encourage users to turn the feature off, which would be counter to the intent of the feature."

How does this affect data usage?? \n\nThird, there must be a way to send messages to someone without having to add the number into my phone's contact list. I'm looking for an apartment and they're all reachable through WhatsApp, but why would I need their number on a long term basis??

If you could make the microphone easier to grab hold of (it is easy to lose hold of it), and perhaps a tap to talk, tap to stop feature instead? Great app!!\n\nETA: Still one of my favorite apps, but myself and several of my family members all have the same request. On Apple phones, using the \"talk\" feature is a challenge. It is hard to grab and even harder to keep your finger on when you're talking. A \"tap to talk\" option would be so much better than having to hold it the entire time to talk. Please, designers, I hope you're reading this. That one feature would make this the best app in the store!!"

It has been a blessing for 100s & Millions of people who could not afford to call or see their friend & loved ones. I have a question about some notifications that appear to ask patrons to forward certain message come from App. Administration suggesting App. Users to forward the message to at least 5, 10 or 15 people to earn qualification to use WhatsApp free. In the past I never believed the messages were authentic & never followed the instruction, and I never had any issues with WhatsApp using it. Please let us know if the messages are sent by someone claiming to be the Director or some high official of WhatsApp. I'm so thankful and appreciative of your WhatsApp & don't remember any technical difficulties that I remember ! The only thing I noticed is losing WhatsApp call when a regular is incoming & WhatsApp call gets disconnected due to no Call waiting Intimation. But that's ok, it's a free call. Thank you all. Sincerely, M. Jilani"

        "content": "WhatsApp has decent core chat capability but suffers from continued feature bloat and the inability to disable functionality that users don't want. For example, it would be great to disable WhatsApp calling entirely. The status tab was also a mistake that, as of yet, the developers refuse to unwind. Not a single contact of mine uses it. It's not what chat apps are for. Better muting of notifications would also be good. If I mute a thread, I want nothing at all from it till the mute expires: no notifications, no badge icons, no unarchiving. Finally, the periodic verification requests for two-step authentication are annoying and inconsistent with my expectations for how the feature should work and with the way I've seen any other app implement this. They're so annoying, that they could encourage users to turn the feature off, which would be counter to the intent of the feature."

It is good for connecting with international folks, for forming family chat groups etc. Some of the shortcomings, unlike linked-in or Facebook, where you can decline an invite, anyone who has your cell number, can using what's app add you to a group chat-without your permission. What's App goes through your contact list and puts a what's app usage indicator for anyone in your contact list and does this likewise on other people's phone. When groups get large enormous files get downloaded through videos. From being a great way to use for business, it became a total waste of my productive time. This is an ideal app for retired people or those not working full time. It is an ideal app for social loafing. I would like to see what's app give more control to user and privacy is non existent. You cannot use what's app without sharing your contact list with what's app. I never have my cell number to Facebook. What's App owned by Facebook, had transferred my cell number to my Facebook account. Parents should be particularly careful to avoid their kids meeting dangerous adults amen bad intentions through chat sessions."

Why change the contacts tab to camera when you can go into the status tab and access the camera from there? The first update was automatic so it didn't give us users much choice in the matter. I've always had to manually update and even the second update allowed for manual updating. I just want to be able to have a regular status that stays until I want to change it.

This allowed us to rescue neighbors, get medical help from neighbors who are part of the medical community when 911 was not working, and then organize volunteer work crews to start checking in on elderly neighbors and finally create volunteer remediation crews. WhatsApp, you are exemplary! Thank you, thank you! Elizabeth SW Houston Texas"

Also it's annoying that I can only see a persons name (if not in my contacts) in the lock screen notification. Once I open the message I can only see the phone number and contact picture.

        "content": "Whatsapp is a pretty good messaging app. I like that many people use it. I love the fact that they added end to end encryption (a must to keep communications private between users).  It generally runs well.\n\nWhat I don't like about Whatsapp is that it requires my phone number to register. A mobile phone number is almost always directly linked to one's identity and can potentially be used to find your name, address, and other personal info. It would be better if Whatsapp allowed registering by picking a username and password with email optional for password recovery.\n\nI also don't like that for the app to work well, it needs access to my contacts info. My contacts info is private to me and my contacts. If Whatsapp used usernames instead of phone numbers, access to my contacts info would not be needed.\n\nIt's obvious that Whatsapp wants to know the identities of their users and their social circle (who they know and who they communicate with).  The terms of service even allow Whatsapp to share your personal information, like your phone number, with its parent company, Facebook, presumably for marketing and advertising purposes.\n\nAnother thing I don't like about Whatsapp is that it's not open source.  The programming code is closed source so programmers cannot independently check the code to ensure there are no backdoors or ways to spy on users' communications. It would be better for users if Whatsapp was 100% open source.\n\nThe only free, full-featured messaging and calling app that I'm aware of that is 100% open source, has end to end encryption at all times, does not require a phone number to register (must go to their website from a computer and click \"open in web\"), and does not require access to any contacts info, is Wire Private Messenger.  Wire's privacy policy and terms of use also doesn't share any of your information with other parties. Signal is a decent option if you don't mind giving your phone number and access to contacts info, which are required. Chatsecure is open source, end to end encrypted, doesn't require phone number or contacts access, but is more of a chat/instant messaging app rather than a full-featured calling and messaging app.  Hope this review was helpful to at least some folks out there. Good luck!"

I did get an email from back from them but it was that they don't maintain your backup talk to Apple. And gave me a link to delete my account! Third party apps have been much more helpful. If you use this app find ways to back up and export your threads regularly! Thank goodness all my photos and videos auto downloaded.

I did and all the response I got till date was an automated email ask me to change the chat wallpaper for some reason. \n\nThe June 15, 2017-Update just got out.. \nI updated the app hoping they might have fixed the crash bug, but guess what?! Absolutely nothing!

Also, if someone messages me it doesn't send a notification. I know this because my iPhone will send me one but not my iPad. The most annoying part about the iPad Pro WhatsApp is that it takes forever to load. Sometimes I have to refresh it a few times before it loads. Sometimes it will tell me that my phone is not connected to the internet which isn't true. So, I have to grab my phone and tap on it to wake it up and then the iPad WhatsApp will have better chances to load. The iPad WhatsApp could definitely use some fixing."

So based on that, I am downgrading you to two thumbs down.\n\nNow to the good. This is a wonderful app, especially when traveling overseas. It allows me, when I'm outside of my home telephone free area, to communicate easily and do so virtually cost free.\n\nWhen I travel overseas, I often travel with two phones: one with my home country SIM card in it and my other phone, with the temporarily purchased SIM card of the country I am visiting. What is particularly aggravating, is that upon returning home and going back to using my regular home phone, WhatsApp, even though I was using the same account while traveling, does not pull my overseas conversations back onto my home phone. That leaves huge holes and discontinuities in important to remember conversations. It's a fault WhatsApp app needs to work on."

VERY ANNOYING!!\n- Even after clearing up all chats, app still keeps lots of undeletable stuck data.\n- Can't clear all media and keep only text chats (no granular \"clear all chats\").\n- No iPad / Apple Watch / iMessage support.\n- Can't backup only text to iCloud (no granular backup).\n- Swipe for media gallery shortcut removed.\n- Archived messages confusing implementation.\n- No background send from other apps (have to wait for the progress bar to complete).\n- Can't search inside individual chats.\n- Confusing \"all starred chats\" UI inside settings: make it like a regular group so we can have all the group features (mass share/save/select-all, etc).\n- If you move your finger while voice recording, you can lose all you already recorded, which is terrible for long messages.\n- No option to demote admins if you are the group creator.\n- Messages that failed to be downloaded have to be redownloaded one by one (Whatsapp should automatically retry downloading all failed messages until they are downloaded).\n- Non-admins can change group icon/name.\n- Web interface and Desktop app depends on phone connection/battery to work (no direct access to Whatsapp's servers).\n- While viewing all media, can't filter for video/photo/audio.\n- Can't make regular calls from Whatsapp itself.\n- No drafts like Telegram.\n- No music player.\n- No native Live Photos send support (stupidly converts it to a gif instead).\n- Clumsy and slow camera UI that crops your photo and takes no Live Photos.\n- Can't filter data usage by cellular/wifi."

You could've added stories but kept status. \nI don't like the new status. If I wanted stories I would've gone to snapchat. But whatsapp is THE BEST for messaging and I don't think it really needs any additions. I don't like the new camera button in the middle either. It's too much like Messenger. Also, Why make them all look the same?  Just keep whatsapp whatsapp \n\nI love that you've added the feature to send up to 30 pics now but hate that I can only send like a minute and a half of a video. 3 mins was already too short. Now I'm breaking down my videos into 4 and 5 pieces. It really is inconvenient."

For the most part, if I take a picture specifically to send to someone and it‚Äôs not a picture I took outside of the app, it‚Äôs something not important enough to waste the space on my phone."

It tries to start recording, but stops even though I'm still pushing it. It now refuses to record at all, voice chats haven't worked for me for a day now. \n\nI have a friend who also uses it on an iPhone, and she is unable to send voice chats longer than 9 seconds.

        "content": "Great app. An app you can reliably count on without crashing is important.\n\nI've been using whatsapp for a while now, recently it has been taking over standard messaging with more and more people being connected through data.\n\nHowever, as more and more people use this app, the more chats and groups you will have. Very quickly you will find yourself endlessly scrolling your chats to just to find the group you want or the contact you want. Sometimes, group pictures alone is not enough to stand out and make you quickly find the chat you are looking for. It's just not quick enough.\n\nSo why not give us the flexibility to quickly group our chats and groups into folders? All my work-related chats, hobby-related chats, and family-related chats will all be in folders at the top, ready at a glance. Won't that be nice?\n\nSuddenly whatsapp would be instantly faster. Not only will you be able to quickly access ALL the groups you frequently talk to, but also you won't have to worry about getting lost in the hundreds of chats you don't frequent.\n\nBesides, I doubt it'll be difficult to make happen. Would be great to see it happen in the coming updates. \n\nI'm sure user friendliness is something you guys value.\n\nKeep up the good work!"

You can never get a hold of a human being, even if you specifically ask for one while you're exchanging multiple emails with someone who says they are an actual human. WhatsApp is great as long as you don't have any issues. Once you do, you're screwed. There's no one to help you, nor does anyone care. They even tried to have me resubmit EVERYTHING just so another person could possibly pick me up to handle my case. That is how lazy and uneducated they are about the app they work for."

Really annoying just to send a random one time or short lived text with someone like when trying to coordinate meeting up to buy or sell something. Also it's annoying that I can only see a persons name (if not in my contacts) in the lock screen notification. Once I open the message I can only see the phone number and contact picture. The organization of this app is terrible. Hopefully Facebook can dedicate some real app designers and developers to overhaul this app. As of now this app is lacking in a lot of ways."

I don't use snapchat, neither have I used Instagram stories for a reason. Now to force those features upon is just wrong! \nPlease sort this is out.

I will go to messages I sent weeks ago and they still aren't blue even though I know they saw them people They responded !!! That is really all I have to say. I give it a 3/5 though."

Do not listen to anyone saying that you do not want this app. I use it because I have many friends that live in Canada and it gets expensive using iMessage or phone calls because international calls are not free. Someone in the reviews said it ran their phone dead , obviously that person doesn't understand how to use their device in the first place. I have had it for two years and not one single problem has came from  using it. Operator error is more than likely the problem with that person's issues. Learn what you're doing before you blame it on something that isn't even the reason."

This inability to connect may last for 1 or 2 days. I've been trying to deleting/reinstalling the app, turning off/on my WiFi and restarting my phone... nothing works! I have to wait for some time before it starts to work properly again itself.

A redesign would be nice too. It's so white on this version while Android has a good tone of Green nicely spread throughout. Still a good job done on the app.\n\nEdit: Message preview works perfect when the phone is locked, however when the phone is unlocked, the message should be displayed on the push notification, even if message preview is enabled."

For example, Wire has more features than whatsapp, including encrypted video calling, GIFs, recalling messages, and expiring messages.  Wire also respects your privacy (doesn't require a phone number or access to all of your contacts data) and is now 100% open source.  Wire has all the other features too like group texting, voice calling, voice and video messaging, and more, all encrypted, all the time, all free with no ads. Whatsapp has recently changed their terms of service to allow whatsapp to share your phone number with their parent company, Facebook, presumably for marketing and advertising purposes.  Wire is not only ad-free, but they don't create profiles of data on their users and will never share your personal information with third parties. If you like whatsapp, then you'll love Wire."

Also I have a personal complain to make. I lost all my pictures and videos on one of my iPhones. The message that I get is that I did not Backup my messages while I had automatic backup to iClouds. I cannot figure out where the problem is or how I can recover my data. Otherwise I am a big fan of the App and use it several times a day."

VERY ANNOYING!!\n- Even after clearing up all chats, app still keeps lots of undeletable stuck data.\n- Can't clear all media and keep only text chats (no granular \"clear all chats\").\n- No iPad / Apple Watch / iMessage support.\n- Can't backup only text to iCloud (no granular backup).\n- Swipe for media gallery shortcut removed.\n- Archived messages confusing implementation.\n- No background send from other apps (have to wait for the progress bar to complete).\n- Can't search inside individual chats.\n- Confusing \"all starred chats\" UI inside settings: make it like a regular group so we can have all the group features (mass share/save/select-all, etc).\n- If you move your finger while voice recording, you can lose all you already recorded, which is terrible for long messages.\n- No option to demote admins if you are the group creator.\n- Messages that failed to be downloaded have to be redownloaded one by one (Whatsapp should automatically retry downloading all failed messages until they are downloaded).\n- Non-admins can change group icon/name.\n- Web interface and Desktop app depends on phone connection/battery to work (no direct access to Whatsapp's servers).\n- While viewing all media, can't filter for video/photo/audio.\n- Can't make regular calls from Whatsapp itself.\n- No drafts like Telegram.\n- No music player.\n- No native Live Photos support (stupidly converts it to a gif instead).\n- Photos taken inside the app are not Live Photos. \n- Clumsy and slow camera UI that crops your photo."

I basically have to redo it and there is the risk again that if someone calls , all is lost! Please do smth about that. Also the fact that if you want to listen to a message you have to stay on that window ... you basically can't do anything else. Why is that? Why can't you give us the option like the app Telegram where you can listen to someone's message and also do other things?"

I can still use the app with a proxy server but that really defeats the purpose of downloading this app. Please fix this if this is a bug, or at least post something that tells us what's causing the problem."

Not that I'm that lazy, but I hate it that every time I have an audio of a minute or so, it slides to left on it's own sooooo easily and just deletes. Can you make it like regular text message where you can just hold it, (maybe change it up where it hold the audio on its own until you click 'stop'?) and when you let go it gives you the option to send or delete ? Instead of it deleting on its own! It's soooo annoying, fix that? Five stars!"

That is a cool feature.\n\n- send volatile messages and images i.e. images that will self-destruct after a few seconds. More like snapchat... that would be awesome...\n\n-Need a feature that will delay sending the messages by 30 sec...more like Gmail.. That will make users more thoughtful and responsible in what they have to communicate...also, will give a second chance to frantic users to undo their messages from sending....this would be a great feature...\n\n- an outbox like feature that would allow users to queue the messages, when sending multiple messages to multiple recipients at a given time. Right now, this is not possible in WhatsApp. This feature when incorporated will appeal to a lot of travelers and people on transit wanting to send messages with limited time and network connectivity. \n\n- better calling features- improved call quality with better sound amplification.....also, the current voice mail feature from the last update is not that great..it is in fact silly if I may say. need a more straightforward approach  we are used to with a regular cell or landline phone....\n\n- group calling feature...must-have feature...\n\n- option to use multiple WhatsApp accounts (at least for two phone numbers) in one device... in that way, one can use WhatsApp for both personal and professional communications, mutually exclusively..."

VERY ANNOYING!!\n- Even after clearing up all chats, app still keeps lots of undeletable stuck data.\n- Can't clear all media and keep only text chats (no granular \"clear all chats\").\n- No iPad / Apple Watch support.\n- Can't backup only text to iCloud (no granular backup).\n- Swipe for media gallery shortcut removed.\n- Hard to view group/contact info or media gallery while \"connecting\".\n- Archived messages confusing implementation.\n- No background send from other apps (have to wait for the progress bar to complete).\n- Can't \"send\" messages if not connected / while in low connectivity areas. Make a send queue.\n- Can't search inside individual chats.\n- Confusing \"all starred chats\" UI inside settings: make it like a regular group so we can have all the group features (mass share/save/select-all, etc).\n- If you move your finger while voice recording, you can lose all you already recorded, which is terrible for long messages.\n- No option to demote admins if you are the group creator.\n- Favorites tab should be populated by the user or removed. \n- Contacts tab should show only Whatsapp contacts or them on top.\n- Messages that failed to be sent/downloaded have to be resent/redownloaded one by one (Whatsapp should automatically retry sending/downloading all failed messages until they are finished).\n- Non-admins can change group icon/name.\n- Can't view all media in web interface.\n- Web interface and Desktop app depends on phone connection/battery to work (no direct access to Whatsapp's servers).\n- While viewing all media, can't filter for video/photo/audio.\n- Can't make regular calls from Whatsapp itself.\n- No drafts like Telegram.\n- No music player.\n- No native Live Photos support (stupidly converts it to a gif instead).\n- Photos taken inside the app are not Live Photos. \n- Clumsy and slow camera UI that crops your photo.\n- Call drops when you lock the phone."

        "content": "Whatsapp is a pretty good messaging app, especially since they added end to end encryption to make communications private. However, Whatsapp is not 100% open source, so there is no way for programmers to independently verify that Whatsapp doesn't in fact have some type of backdoor or bypass that makes it possible for the Whatsapp company or others to record or log communications. Also, Whatsapp has changed their terms of service to allow them to share your phone number with their parent company, Facebook, presumably for marketing purposes. Finally, whatsapp still requires registration with a phone number and access to all of your iPhone contacts information.\n\nI've since switched to Wire Private Messenger. It free, no ads, and has more features than WhatsApp. It is 100% open source so you know there are people out there checking the code to ensure no spying is possible. Also, Wire does not require access to your iPhone contacts info (it's optional) and you can register with a phone number or email address (go to their website, select \"open in web\" and wait a bit).  Wire's terms of service does not log your communications, does not profile you, and does not share or sell any of your information. I've since gotten some friends to try it and they prefer it over WhatsApp."

We should be allowed to search for specific words in chats like in Android and have the option to send music (understandable if this can't be done due to Apples policies). A redesign would be nice too. It's so white on this version while Android has a good tone of Green nicely spread throughout. Still a good job done on the app.\n\nEdit: Message preview works perfect when the phone is locked, however when the phone is unlocked, the message should be displayed on the push notification, even if message preview is enabled."

Wire has all the other features too like group texting, voice calling, GIFs and much more, all encrypted, all the time, all free. Whatsapp has recently changed their terms of service to allow whatsapp to share your phone number with their parent company, Facebook, presumably for marketing and advertising purposes.  Wire is not only ad-free, but they will never share your personal information with third parties. If you like whatsapp, then you'll love Wire."

Its not extremely pretty or anything but its not ugly by any means. Im happy with all the chat wallpapers that are included by default and most of the icons are clean looking.\n\nI'm not sure what the deal is but the app will save images from chat to my camera roll.

        "content": "Whatsapp is a pretty good messaging app, especially since they added end to end encryption to make communications private. However, Whatsapp is not 100% open source, so there is no way for programmers to independently verify that Whatsapp doesn't in fact have some type of backdoor or bypass that makes it possible for the Whatsapp company or others to record or log communications. Also, Whatsapp has changed their terms of service to allow them to share your phone number with their parent company, Facebook, presumably for marketing purposes. Finally, whatsapp still requires registration with a phone number and access to all of your iPhone contacts information.\n\nI've since switched to Wire Private Messenger. It free, no ads, and has more features than WhatsApp. It is 100% open source so you know there are people out there checking the code to ensure no spying is possible. Also, Wire does not require access to your iPhone contacts info (it's optional) and you can register with a phone number or email address (go to their website, select \"open in web\" and wait a bit).  Wire's terms of service does not log your communications, does not profile you, and does not share or sell any of your information. I've since gotten some friends to try it and they prefer it over WhatsApp."

Now, the only way to manage and see that is if you go to chats and click on the new message icon. It's disastrous. Contact list was simple and easy. Took out a vital part of the app only to replace it with something that's hardly being used. Out of my 200+ contacts, about 4-5 people under my contacts use the supposed \"Snapchat\" feature. Bring back contacts and stay somewhat original and your ratings will change."

So receive on server, download to phone but retain on server.

Until subscriber buys space -25 GB increments - for annual fee. Software to automatically store videos in a folder, pictures in a folder and text in third folder. This can be premium service.

The android version is much more clean and simple. It's dark green banner, and simple paginated view is much more visually appealing. Also, let's get that larger green arrow button too. \nIn fact, just a straight up carbon copy would be better than the button tabs and stark white we have right now on iOS"

It's becoming more and more like Snapchat! Let's leave these similar features alone and leave hem to Snapchat. What was once a unique app is not anymore. Please revert to the previous version!! Please and thanks.\nI do not want to see status updates or status on the side like how it is now. It's retarded. If you want to change WhatsApp aleast let users change color variations in writing etc on WhatsApp and other effect instead of being similar like your competitors. WhatsApp is losing its originality!! I don't care for 24hr status updates \n\nRevert back to the previous version!!!\n\nI can't see my contacts. I have to type in names to find someone to hat to. Who wants to type in a contact name allllll the time! What if a name is stored as a nickname and for some reason one might forget what their contact is under... bring back the chat option! Take away the status!!!!! \n\nI was able to just scroll down my chat option and look for someone to talk to... easily... now... I can't. I have to type in a name... \n\nI don't want to see people's statuses every two seconds. \nWhatsApp is losing its originality!! Revert to the previous version!!\n\nIt would be better to add marquee effects or any other effects to see on WhatsApp. Personalize it to ones own taste!!\n\nPlease please please revert to the previous version or update WhatsApp again and take the new \"status\" feature AWAYYY!!!!"

Typos couldn't be corrected, message couldn't be recalled or deleted after sent unlike many other apps out there. The lack of this feature has caused me several embarrassments.\n\n2. Also when typing long messages, as soon as you move to the second line, the first line disappeared from view, you don't get to see all the message until you are on the third line or more, so inconvenient if you would want to review message before sending, more so since errors could not be corrected.\n\nThere is no denying that the app has some great new features, like text bold, status updates etc, but in my review it rates far below other apps based on the two snags listed above.\nI will be willing update my review whenever these snags are corrected."

For sure when it's like 50 of them. So if you could just add a play all unread messages tab that would guarantee 5 stars from me.. just would make the app a lot more user friendly.\n\nUpdate... After the recent update all voice messages show different times for the length of the message than the actual length.. please fix this, it is very annoying."

Messages would not send to my contacts and all the while the app was telling me they had been sent. This happened with 4 conversations.\n\nLastly, please, please don't turn this app into a bloated mess of hybrid messenger with media as your Messenger Facebook app is. Many of us despise that app because it is overtly decorated, and has too many features you just don't use.\n\nPlease keep whatsapp simple and take the camera Snapchat thing away.\nI'm not being a reactionary, I appreciate media featured in new apps, but your answer to the competition shouldn't be to prostitute our beloved whatsapp into a mutant Snapchat/Facebook/instagram messenger app, thank you."

I don't know what they did but they broke a perfectly working and fine product.  The broadcast forwarding capability was the single most thing that was of value and it's gone.  Takes at least 2 seconds for the menu to come on long press for message or media on a chat.  Very very slow on iPhone 6 running iOS 10.  It's like they have forgotten what scalability looks like.  Whatsapp was a very marvelous example of a lightweight yet feature rich app before Facebook bought and screwed it up.  For Shame!!"

        "content": "My dearest WhatsApp:\n\nIt's been a long time since we've met and I can't deny we've spent a wonderful time together. However, I saw you've changed drastically and that concerns me so much. I tried to understand you but never received any explanation about.\n\nNow I think it's the right time to give a small twist to our lives... but now separately. As Cher's song says: \"I found someone to take away the heartache\", it's the just I can't stand your constant changes and the cat that you totally lost your focus point and don't step up to the plate anymore.\n\nBaby, at first you were authentic: you were yourself and everybody else could've wanted to be like you, but now you're pretending to be like someone else. It's disappointing that now you're only a wannabe, and I know it's difficult to ask you to be the same as before, so I don't have more options except to say... Goodbye!\n\nP.S. If someday you feel lost, ask Telegram (my new love) for some advices that I bet will work for you."

        "content": "Hi, this is a suggestion I would like to offer...\nIs there any way you guys can make the voicenotes so that you can preview them before sending? as opposed to now when you just release and they're sent automatically. \nSometimes you talk for a long period of time and realized you could've condensed what you were saying and if you're lucky and swipe left the voicenote is deleted and you can record a new one but sometimes you just accidentally release your finger and it's too late, now it's already sent...\nOther times (I know a lot of people get mixed up when chatting simultaneously with different persons or groups), and a voicenote ends up in the wrong place, so I'm absolutely sure everyone will appreciate if you offer that feature. \nAnyhow I truly hope you would consider to include this idea in a future update, Thanks!"

Make a send queue.\n- Can't search inside individual chats.\n- Confusing \"all starred chats\" UI inside settings: make it like a regular group so we can have all the group features (mass share/save/select-all, etc).\n- If you move your finger while voice recording, you can lose all you already recorded, which is terrible for long messages.\n- No option to demote admins if you are the group creator.\n- Favorites tab should be populated by the user or removed. \n- Contacts tab should show only Whatsapp contacts or them on top.\n- Messages that failed to be sent/downloaded have to be resent/redownloaded one by one (Whatsapp should automatically retry sending/downloading all failed messages until they are finished).\n- Non-admins can change group icon/name.\n- Can't view all media in web interface.\n- Web interface and Desktop app depends on phone connection/battery to work (no direct access to Whatsapp's servers).\n- While viewing all media, can't filter for video/photo/audio.\n- Can't make regular calls from Whatsapp itself.\n- No stickers.\n- No drafts like Telegram.\n- No music player.\n- No native Live Photos support (stupidly converts it to a gif instead).\n- Photos taken inside the app are not Live Photos. \n- Clumsy and slow camera UI that crops your photo.\n- Call drops when you lock the phone."

VERY ANNOYING!!\n- Even after clearing up all chats, app still keeps lots of undeletable stuck data.\n- Can't clear all media and keep only text chats (no granular \"clear all chats\").\n- No iPad / Apple Watch / iMessage support.\n- Can't backup only text to iCloud (no granular backup).\n- Swipe for media gallery shortcut removed.\n- Archived messages confusing implementation.\n- No background send from other apps (have to wait for the progress bar to complete).\n- Can't search inside individual chats.\n- Confusing \"all starred chats\" UI inside settings: make it like a regular group so we can have all the group features (mass share/save/select-all, etc).\n- If you move your finger while voice recording, you can lose all you already recorded, which is terrible for long messages.\n- No option to demote admins if you are the group creator.\n- Favorites tab should be populated by the user or removed. \n- Contacts tab should show only Whatsapp contacts or them on top.\n- Messages that failed to be downloaded have to be redownloaded one by one (Whatsapp should automatically retry downloading all failed messages until they are downloaded).\n- Non-admins can change group icon/name.\n- Can't view all media in web interface.\n- Web interface and Desktop app depends on phone connection/battery to work (no direct access to Whatsapp's servers).\n- While viewing all media, can't filter for video/photo/audio.\n- Can't make regular calls from Whatsapp itself.\n- No drafts like Telegram.\n- No music player.\n- No native Live Photos support (stupidly converts it to a gif instead).\n- Photos taken inside the app are not Live Photos. \n- Clumsy and slow camera UI that crops your photo.\n- Call drops when you lock the phone."

Based on other recent reviews, it seems many people feel the same as I do.\n\nI used the old status messages to let my business contacts know the days and times I was available to chat/talk. That's not even possible now.\n\nIf I want to see people's photos, I'll go on Instagram or Facebook. They've even hidden the contact list for sending messages (it's now in the \"chats\" window, instead of its own button on the main app screen).\n\nI'm probably going to switch to Viber if WhatsApp doesn't modify or remove this feature."

If I call someone and they decide for any variety of reasons not to take that call, WhatsApp openly declares the call \"Declined,\" if that's how the receiver of the telephone reacted. \"Unanswered\" or \"Missed Call\" would serve a much less innocuous end to the initiator of the call.

Now every time I get a text im conditioned into thinking that i just got an update from ESPN or something... Also the chat title/name/'typing' are not centered and there is a lot of wasted space between the persons name and the phone call button at the top of the chat.\n\nAlso not a fan of the new UI the camera button looks bulky and weird and the Send button looks too big, but thats my prerogative.\n\nFIX THE NOTIFICATION SOUND BUG\n\nEdit: Using iPhone 7 with updated iOS 10.0.3"
