        "content": "This past Saturday evening I requested an Uber pick up from the hotel my friends and I were staying at, this happened around 10:15 PM. After waiting 15 minutes the driver, Cuong, called twice telling me he couldn't find us. He said a street was closed and he had no idea how to get to us. In the middle of the second call he hung up and charged me, without EVER reaching the pick up point. Somehow, I am being charged for the trip he took to try and find us instead of him actually driving us anywhere. We had to wait another 20 minutes for a shuttle to drive us. After reporting this to customer care I was told 4 times that \"based on previous rides\" that it was likely I took this trip. I can guarantee I did NOT take this trip considering the starting and end location were NOWHERE near the hotel we were at! Countless messages where I throughly explained how this was an inconceivable pick up and drop off were disregarded by customer service and I was told they'd be closing the case without any effort actually exerted by the company. I will have to dispute the charge with my bank and also cancel any relationship I currently have with this terrible ride service. It's a shame the good drivers will have to miss out on fares and income due to Cuong's lack of direction and customer services lack of, well, customer service at the very least. Not a surprise the overall company and app has MAYBE 1.5 stars."

Recently I moved to LA and it's just ridiculous out here, drivers driving completely past you, getting canceled constantly, and just the overall attitude of some of the drivers(a lot of pervs too). Yet even with all that I wouldn't rate it 1 star until what happened recently. A driver decided to NOT pick me up, and start the trip without me.\n Of course I give the guy a call ... doesn't answer, so I call again... no answer. Third time I call he picks up(at this point he is already at my destination without me), he goes on to say the app was being \"weird\" and wasn't working... so instead of trying to contact me he ignored my calls and finished a trip without me in it. \n\nAny sane person would want a refund right? Wrong. According to Uber's customer service I \"completed\" the trip and can't be refunded. It's obvious at this point he did all of this on purpose so I couldn't get a refund and he gets free money. Extremely frustrating, horrible customer service! This is the first time I've ever tried to refund a trip, so I'm not abusing it by any means. I deleted the app and won't be supporting them any more, think twice about using Uber!"

Also when I request an Uber the time would say 7mins for example which is do-able for me then it changes to 14 mins which is way too long and I have to cancel but get charged a cancellation fee b/c the app gave me two different times. Also, one time I had caught an uber pool and there were two other people there as well usually it's one other person and if it's two their together. So the lady had to drop all three of us off. She drop the one girl off then dropped the guy off so I'm thinking I'm next but then the app tell her to pick someone else up. She picked her up dropped her off I am still in the car my trip should have taken me 7 mins but took 30 mins instead. She had to turn the uber app off b/c it was telling her to pick people off instead of dropping me off. On top with of that I had my son with me who was hungry b/c it took us so long to get home. On top of that when you take an uber pool sometime the other passenger is not on the way to where you going."

The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button!!! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic!!! I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!!!

Customer support, or rather lack of support, will reply with cookie cutter responses that don't address any real problems or concerns and they refuse to give refunds, only credits, even if you shouldn't have been charged in the first place. What good is a credit if I don't want to use Uber again. On top of all of this, there are multiple allegations of harassment internally at Uber, and allegations of assault by drivers.\nYou would be wise to avoid using Uber!\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n 开发者回复：This doesn't sound right.

This is just stupid of Uber. \n\nI suggest you try some of excellent alternatives that don't abuse personal information.  Most of the same exact drivers work for the alternatives too, but without the troubling personal privacy practices offered by Uber.  And most alternatives, I have learned, are less expensive.  We all win!\n\nOriginal Review: \nSince the app and service are tightly coupled, my review is for both. \n\nOverall, very good. Generally better than a cab. I have had one problem driver - crazy guy - but likely no less crazy than some cab drivers I have had. \n\nApp could be easier to use, but it is quite good."

So, Uber, include release notes so your app's ratings can go up, because people that actually use your app and leave reviews also read the release notes.

Then you deducted the $4 from my other $15 credit. Ridiculous. And I didn't realize or see a breakdown until my trip was over and I got my receipt. Had I known my ride was $19 for the short distance I was going I would've never booked it or chose to spend my credit that way, which is probably why you do this to deceive your riders about pricing. I should have been allowed to see how much the ride was before I applied my credit so I could judge for myself whether I should book the ride or not.

In the last year, whenever I'd request a ride, there was roughly a 50/50 chance that the driver would actually show up, as many drivers (upon being hailed through he app) would drive in a direction away from my pick up location. I later learned that this is a form of protest from Uber drivers in response to their dropping pay. By driving away from your pick up location, they would leave the passenger stranded, forcing he to cancel the ride, which would then yield a small payment to the driver. Uber's cars are also not what they used to be. You'd normally get a newer model vehicle that's clean. In the last year, more and more of their vehicles have been neglected and drivers have been more and more unhappy. Last but not least, after deciding to write this review here on the App Store, I've noticed duplicate 5-star reviews by users with random alphanumeric usernames praising Uber and offering coupon codes.

In a city like San Francisco this can be a huge safety factor as well as a major issue for the quality of the experience for the passenger.    \n\nThis app takes that option away. Perfect example...a passenger at a grocery store requested a ride from me yesterday. Map software looks at the pin and gets you as close a it can. In this case, I was directed to the loading dock behind the store. The passenger said he was already standing in the front of the store when he set up and requested the ride. He was a very experienced uber customer and knew the nuances of how to use the app well.\n\nHow can this be a good thing?\n\nThis alone wastes time for both the driver and passenger. It reduces the quality of the ride experience for both the driver and passenger. It creates safety issues in areas of cities where the back alleys may be a lot more dangerous than the main streets.\n\nThe app does more to make the driving experience more difficult,  but these are the issues I see affecting riders, from the perspective of a driver who actually cares what the ride experience is like for passengers."

No they don't wait until you tip or not. Unlike this app, drivers need to rate quickly in order to get another request and keep working. Stop making up fake stories. With Taxis, you can also tip.

A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button!!! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic!!!

        "content": "As a driver, I'm able to view what the rider pays and the breakdown between ubers commission, black car fund (NYC), sales tax, and obviously my payout. \n\nUbers Payouts in NYC used to be 25% commission and 8.875% black car fund. Lately they have been overcharging the rider and paying the driver as little as 50%. \n\nI've had trips where the driver payout is $14 but rider is charged $26. Ubers commission alone is $10. For another ride, the total fare was $106, Uber commission was $33. The reason why this happens is Uber grossly miscalculates the route, or outright OVERCHARGES the rider. They do this on X rides to subsidize their pool rides. Honestly it is such a shame, such sleazy tactics. If we use faster routes, Uber ends up keeping the difference, rather than crediting the passenger or paying the driver. According to this, it is in our best interest to take the LONGEST possible route. \n\nDo yourself a favor as a rider and calculate the mileage and time driven. Then look at your overall cost. The rates are listed publicly I'm each region. YOU WILL BE SHOCKED AT HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'RE TAKING. It's straight manipulative, deceptive and demeaning. This has to change and stop. \n\nOn top of that their support downright disgusting; they have a system where as soon as they respond to a question it is selected as RESOLVED. I've had completed Quests where I have not received my bonus, they listed as resolved and say wait 24-48 hours, after that they say wait till next pay statement, how is this issue resolved if I haven't received the funds nor is it reflected in the balance? It should instead say responded, or replied back to. \n\nUNBIASEDLY this is the WORST rideshare company. Everything I have said is OBJECTIVELY true."

I have had an uber driver take an hour and a half to get me to my destination when I was only 12 minutes away from the designated destination. I have also had the experience of being charged $5 for a false cancelation fee. I was waiting for my driver for 20 minutes outside, but not once did they appear to my pickup. I was then charged a cancellation fee and then given the $5 as credit. As many times as I have tried to get a refund for each of these events, uber support has failed each time and show no remorse for their actions. Therefore, I will now take Lyft as a confident alternative."

I used lyft instead so that I wouldn't be bothered with connecting with the same uber driver again. Imagine how upset I was after already being in my lyft ride to get a call from another uber driver stating he is at my pick up. I DID NOT REQUEST ANOTHER RIDE AFTER BEING CANCELED ON TWICE. I was charged a cancellation fee for a ride I never requested and tried multiple times to contact uber help about this issue, which they blatantly ignored me. They even deleted the help messages I have sent because it is no longer available for me to see it. I had to call my bank to dispute the charge. This is not the only problem I have but it is the most upsetting. I've heard bad stories from drivers as well. My recommendation is to stay away from uber and use lyft."

The Uber app pulls the resale value out of your car to Pay YOU. Uber needs to compensate and pay the drives real money, so they can fix and maintain there car's. Uber doesn't pay much to the drivers at all (Uber keeps about 60% of what the rider pay UBER). Once you consider your fuel cost, extremely high cost of ride-share car insurance, car maintenance and the terrible wear and tear on the car itself plus significant lose of value of your car at resale, especially because of the super high miles on your vehicle. The Uber app is a very bad deal for the drive. However the riders are getting a great deal on your dime and time.  Sorry for the bad new.\n\nHere's a timeline of Uber's troubles so far this year.\n\n- Jan. 28: After President Donald Trump releases his first executive order on immigration, New York taxi drivers protest by refusing to pick up passengers at Kennedy Airport for an hour. Some protesters say Uber tries to capitalize on the protest by picking up passengers anyway, prompting a Twitter protest urging people to delete Uber's app from their smartphones.\n\n- Feb. 2: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quits President Trump's council of business leaders amid mounting pressure from employees and customers over the immigration order.\n\n- Feb. 19: A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, discloses sexual harassment and sexism claims in a blog post about her year at Uber. Fowler says her boss propositioned her and higher-ups ignored her complaints. Kalanick calls Fowler's accusations \"abhorrent\" and hires former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate.\n\n- Feb. 23: Waymo, a self-driving car company spun off from Google, sues Uber. Waymo alleges that Anthony Levandowski - a former top manager for Google's self-driving car project - stole pivotal technology from Google before leaving to run Uber's self-driving car division.\n\n- Feb. 28: A video emerges of Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver. It includes yelling and profanity and ends with a combative Kalanick dismissing the agitated driver's claims that sharp reductions in fares forced him into bankruptcy. In an email to employees, Kalanick admits he needs leadership help. \"I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,\" he says.\n\n- March 3: The New York Times reveals that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber's so-called Greyball software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating Uber's use of the Greyball software.\n\n- March 19: Uber's president, Jeff Jones, resigns less than a year after joining the company. He tells the tech blog Recode that his approach to leadership is at odds with what he experienced at Uber.\n\n- April 18: Sherif Marakby, a global vice president who leads Uber's self-driving car program, leaves the company.\n\n- April 27: Levandowski announces he is stepping aside while Uber defends itself against the allegations from Waymo.\n\n- May 11: A federal judge in San Francisco rejects Uber's request for arbitration and refers Waymo's case to the U.S. Attorney's office for a possible criminal investigation. Days later the judge bans Uber from using technology taken from Waymo, but doesn't order Uber to halt its self-driving vehicle program, as Waymo requested. The case is set for trial in October.\n\n- May 26: Kalanick's mother dies in a boating accident. His father is seriously injured.\n\n- May 30: Uber fires Levandowski.\n\n- May 31: Uber's finance chief Gautam Gupta says he plans to leave the company in July.\n\n- June 6: Uber fires 20 people after a law firm, Perkins Coie, investigates complaints of harassment, bullying and retaliation. That investigation, which was separate from Holder's, checked into 215 complaints; 57 are still under investigation.\n\n- June 11: Uber's board meets with Holder and adopts a series of recommendations based on his report.\n\n- June 12: Emil Michael, Uber's senior vice president for business and a close ally of Kalanick, leaves the company.\n\n- June 13: Kalanick tells Uber employees that he's taking a leave for an unspecified period, but will be available for \"the most strategic decisions.\" Uber's board releases Holder's recommendations, which include removing some of Kalanick's responsibilities and replacing Uber's chairman and founder, Garrett Camp, with an independent chairman. Holder also recommends many cultural and policy changes, from establishing an effective complaint process to recruiting more diverse applicants to prohibiting alcohol and drug use during core work hours."

Sexual harassment of women, spying on current and past customers long after the app has been deleted, the CEO Travis Kalanick caught on camera pretty much being himself, an unpleasant and terrible human being, and the straw that broke the camel's back? The suicide of one of your engineers, Joseph Thomas. I can no longer support this company. I'm deleting my info and the rest of you that praises this app can all have it!"

Yesterday 2 uber drivers couldn't find me because uber didn't pick up my location correctly so they both cancelled my rides and I had no way to get home late at night after class. Uber frequently over charges me on accident (?) so I'm constantly having to take time out of my day to email them to credit my money back to my bank account. It's incredibly frustrating. If I had a choice, I would never use this app. Lyft is definitely better but a bit pricier, and like I said, I'm on a college budget, so I stick to Uber's abuse. If you have the means to avoid using this horrible app, please do yourself a favor and don't use uber."

I also had a $20 coupon for referring a friend. This time I was charged $19 for the ride in advance and then refunded the money at the end. How is this acceptable? It's a credit/discount NOT a rebate. This update has destroyed any quality than Uber had left, which wasn't much considering so many of their drivers now are complete racists.

What garbage. \n\nI don't like the customer service, but the drivers are even worse. 9 times out of 10 they get lost trying to find my apartment- and next thing you know, my ETA has gone from 3 minutes to 10 minutes! Since I tend to only take Uber when I'm in a major hurry, I often have to cancel if the the ETA jumps like that. But then I get charged fees and get low ratings from drivers, even though it was *them* who got lost while I was waiting at the correct address the whole time! Really!? The drivers also have a habit of either taking long routes, or simply not knowing where they're going whatsoever. Uber needs to have much stricter hiring criteria and regulations, because I'm so tired of having to deal with directionally challenged drivers all the time."

When I book a ride, it says personal or work, but doesn't reconfirm that the charge will be on the appropriate card. On a recent personal trip, I went back and forth on the app to confirm the charge card, but I was never sure which card was being charged. The personal trip ended up being charged to my work credit card -- NOT GOOD. Ideally, it should confirm the credit card before the final order of the ride. I have now removed my work rides and will get a Yellow Taxi or a local limo service for my work related trips (mostly to/ from airport). \n\nSecondly, changing and deleting the credit card required looking up the help! Even after I had seen the instructions, the procedure was less than obvious. I could not update the card details and had to delete and re-enter all the details. Since I entered one incorrect digit in the card expiration date, I had to enter the card details a second time (deleting the first entry) instead of only editing the expiration date!  Overall, the app is unfriendly to use. \n\nI will use the app because there is no option but to use the app for Uber rides. Definitely not a happy camper."

I went back and forth three times with Uber customer service and they refused to explain to me how they verified her claim aside from saying she sent them random photos. They also had the nerve to say that I wasn't being accused and that they were interested in hearing my side of the story...yet they had already charged me for the damage. They basically sent me the same four lines over and over again. If you still decide to take Uber, PLEASE take pictures of the inside of the car before and after you enter it since the burden of proof WILL be on you if your driver is like mine and submits false photos of damage against you.

I do not know what is going on with this version though, when I type in an address as either my pick up or drop off location it will sometimes prompt me to pick a pick up point close by. This has confused a couple of my drivers because instead of giving the exact address to pick me up it gives them a range and they drive back and forth sometimes even passing me. Another thing I've noticed with this recent update is though convenient for places you go to often, if I select one of my frequent locations on the bottom in the circles it tells the driver the address and not that they are looking for a store or restaurant and again the drivers pass me up or drive in circles until I either call or text them and tell them to pull into a parking lot. I really like uber and rely on it daily but lately it's been a bit of a headache. Hopefully with the next update these little things can get fixed."

Not sure how true that is, but i wouldnt be surprised considering the app uses your location LITERALLY 24/7. Uber is not a good company and seems to only care about the money.

A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!

Once you consider your fuel cost, extremely high cost of ride-share car insurance, car maintenance and the terrible wear and tear on the car itself plus significant lose of value of your car at resale, especially because of the super high miles on your vehicle. The Uber app is a very bad deal for the drive. However the riders are getting a great deal on your dime and time. Sorry for the bad new."

He passed me as he was leaving and explained what happened. I then ordered another uber, and though he was right there, I had to wait another 20 minutes for a different car. In all it took almost as long as walking and I was charged 5 dollars for a cancelation. IF I EVER use uber again, it will be out of utter desperation."

GPS. There are multiple GPS problems in the \"Smart City\" of Singapore but somehow Uber compounds them. Three things to consider fixing Uber:\n\n1. You app continuously allocates fares to drivers traveling in the opposition direction form the pick up location. This takes a 4 minute estimate and turns it into an 8-10 minute reality while the driver navigates one way diversions in order to turn around\n\n2. The GPS is particularly slow to refresh in the new version. A driver who seems a ways away is suddenly waiting outside. See 1 for the compounding effect of not really knowing when a driver will turn up\n\n3. My own home address can't seem to \"stick\" because the app comes up with its own version of where I want to be picked up. Ever since the change drivers are constantly going to the wrong address\n\nOne question for all: why?"

The stated intent is to only collect location data up to 5 minutes after a trip. This would allow them to better suggest drop off locations. The problem is there is nothing on the user's side that enforces this. If Uber were to change that policy, there would be no way to know unless a user actively checks or Uber tells users. This is not acceptable. My privacy is more important to me than Uber's analytics. \n\nPlease give us the option to only allow access to location data while the app is open. I have been forced to block all location access to the app making it much less convenient to use."

        "content": "UPDATE 2: As others have pointed out, Uber is likely pushing new updates just to clear out the bad reviews. They're hoping people will lose interest after a while and they can get away with their deceptive privacy practices unchecked.\n\nUPDATE: It looks like Uber was forced to remove the obvious lie from their app description, but with this version of the app they still can monitor your location at all times--not just when you've used Uber recently. And what about all the people who allowed the app to monitor their location because they believed the lie? The latest \"feature\" described in this update shows Uber never intended to keep that promise even for a second. Shame on them.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI'm an iOS developer and the  description about how they'll use your location information is simply not true. With this configuration not only can they monitor your location for up to 5 minutes after you use the app, but also for up to 5 minutes *practically any time they want*, whether you've used the app or not.\n\nAdditionally, apps that monitor your location all the time are one of the bigger causes of battery drain, even on newer devices.\n\nTo the developers:\n\nJust be honest--you're yet another company who wants to snoop in on where people go and make a few extra bucks selling that information to the highest bidder. Many people will use the app anyway.\n\nThe really irritating thing is that you easily could have left the original option (to get location info only while the app is being used) so that tech savvy people could change it in Settings. Instead you chose to explicitly remove that option and try to force people to accept something that benefits you at the expense of their batteries. Deleted. If you want my business you'll have to bring the option back. Aside from Lyft, there are still plenty of cabs in D.C. and thanks to the competition the cabs are much better than they used to be."

All in all an ok experience.

I try to cancel the trip but it doesn't work. I search they all the menus of the app trying to reset my password or remove my payment method and nothing! I submit a report to Uber of suspicious activity and I hear nothing for 24-hours. In the meantime this person has taken 2 trips on my dime! I finally hear from Uber and I'm thinking great they'll straighten this out... Nope I was wrong. They tell me they recognize the devise used as mine and the trip consistent with my history! What! I've never been to Detroit and the one trip I took was in Seattle! They listed two names on he account that weren't mine too. All they did was reset my password which I had already done (hint you have to click I forgot my password) to reset it. Anyway I'm still waiting for a response from Uber.

In the past the app would stop to notify you to make sure you accept this increased rate before requesting your ride. Upon receiving your receipt you'd be notified of the up charge on your regular fare due to surge pricing. However, since about October 2016 they've stopped notifying riders of surge pricing and have removed the surge pricing notification on their receipts as well. Be warned, if you don't see it on the tiny price estimate before requesting your ride then you'll be charged extra for your fare without any indication as to why. And as I found out this afternoon, Uber doesn't care if you ever know or not and contacting customer support will only have you be rudely told that you were charged surge pricing and notified of it without any evidence to prove any notification was issued. Worst customer service I have ever dealt and the shadiest pricing system I have ever seen! I use ride sharing services 8-12 times a week and I have never been so disgusted by such a lack of quality in this service before.

They treat their drivers like crap, their drivers treat their customers like crap, no one is held accountable for anything that happens to passengers. There is no way to ensure that your driver is a safe or educated driver. I can't count how many times individual drivers have made me carsick, ran red lights, and almost run pedestrians over with me in the car. There's not even a guarantee that your uber driver isn't driving you home drunk right now as you're reading this. It's disgusting, it shouldn't be allowed. On top of the generally horrible service quality, this app continues to get worse and harder to use each time it's updated. I now have to go out of my way to make sure that the default address chosen by the gps as a pickup point is actually where I am! What a joke! GPS is too inaccurate to put my driver at my CLEARLY NUMBERED front door when given an address, yet now Uber is charging fare for passengers who don't make it to the car in time? This company is complete and utter horse crap! Go out of business already!"

This is just stupid Uber. \n\nI suggest you try some of excellent alternatives that don't make the sameo private data management error.  Most of the same exact drivers work for the alternatives too, but without the troubling personal privacy practices offered by Uber.  And most alternatives, I have learned, are less expensive.  We all win!\n\nOriginal Review: \nSince the app and service are tightly coupled, my review is for both. \n\nOverall, very good. Generally better than a cab.

They're hoping people will lose interest after a while and they can get away with their deceptive privacy practices unchecked.\n\nUPDATE: It looks like Uber was forced to remove the obvious lie from their app description, but with this version of the app they still can monitor your location at all times--not just when you've used Uber recently. And what about all the people who allowed the app to monitor their location because they believed the lie? The latest \"feature\" described in this update shows Uber never intended to keep that promise even for a second. Shame on them.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI'm an iOS developer and the  description about how they'll use your location information is simply not true. With this configuration not only can they monitor your location for up to 5 minutes after you use the app, but also for up to 5 minutes *practically any time they want*, whether you've used the app or not.\n\nAdditionally, apps that monitor your location all the time are one of the bigger causes of battery drain, even on newer devices.\n\nTo the developers:\n\nJust be honest--you're yet another company who wants to snoop in on where people go and make a few extra bucks selling that information to the highest bidder. Many people will use the app anyway.\n\nThe really irritating thing is that you easily could have left the original option (to get location info only while the app is being used) so that tech savvy people could change it in Settings. Instead you chose to explicitly remove that option and try to force people to accept something that benefits you at the expense of their batteries. Deleted. If you want my business you'll have to bring the option back. Aside from Lyft, there are still plenty of cabs in D.C. and thanks to the competition the cabs are much better than they used to be.\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n 开发者回复：This doesn't sound right.

If the past year has taught us anything, it's \"don't trust Uber to do the right thing\". \n\nIt looks like they're not in a hurry to listen to customers' complaints, since we're at least thirteen updates in since I started paying attention to the GPS issue. It also seems like they abuse the app update system. Weekly 170MB updates with no change log. That's half a gig per month, thanks guys..\n\nPartial workaround for tracking: disable GPS for the Uber app, and only turn it back on if you absolutely need to use the app. And then turn it back off when you get to the destination. \n\nIn the meantime I've been using the friendly Uber competitor, and so far it's worked like a charm. Thanks Uber, for encouraging me to check out other apps!"

The driver picked us up, verified the address we entered was correct AND in Denver then proceeded to drive us to our destination. Nothing was said about additional fees and we thought nothing of it until the charge hit our bank accounts and we had been unknowingly charged an additional $160!!!! I tried working with their Customer service for an equally fair resolution but soon concluded that I was clearly wasting my time and theirs. \n\nSo, thank you Lyft for being an honest and fair company and uber.... well I have nothing nice to say and will leave it at that!!"

The biggest one for me is that the app takes the closest large place and says that is where you are.  For example I was just at a hotel asking for a Uber and it kept saying that my location was at the convention center 2 blocks away... even though my location was exactly at the hotel.  It then proceeds to ask you what door at the convention center you are at, you cannot change where you want picked up. This also happens at airports, if you are on airport property it assumes you want picked up at the terminal instead of a private terminal."

It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!"

My driver rating has taken a plunge because of the garbage this app has turned into.\n\nThe only conversation I've had in rides is how terrible the update is, how frustrating it was for us to find each other, and how Lyft is so much better and easier. Also we're not stupid - you want to use our locations \"for up to 5 minutes after a ride\" so you can collect the data of where we're going and sell it to the highest bidder. No thanks.

This happened with a third driver as well—fortunately was able to connect through the chat interface of the app—and yet, had it not been for this he would have never reached me. Instead of the estimated 5 minutes for him to arrive it took over 15 since he (like the 2 previous drivers) continued taking inexplicable detours that differed from the projected path I was seeing on my phone. \nEventually it was only by moving between the map interface on the app and the chat with the driver, and sending him directions as he drove that I was able to get him to follow the very simple route which my phone clearly indicated he was meant to take. Did I mention it was impossible to connect via cell phone with him too! All in all, it was 45 minutes later (than my first attempted ride) before I was able to leave."

For a simple address in Colombia it showed me 5 different options, and the first one was nowhere near where I needed to go (actually a pretty bad neighborhood but fortunately I am familiar with the city!). \nAdditionally, the most annoying thing is that you may see 3 or 4 drivers in your area, but the app matches you to someone who is headed to your destination area, so this increases wait times for a ride considerably (a 2 min wait can become a 7 min wait). \nTaxis are very cheap in Colombia but Uber used to offer a better service in terms of getting a ride faster... if wait times become equal then you begin to lose a comparative advantage and riders!!"

My husband and I have been trying for 2 days to set my college bound daughter up with Uber under a family plan. It has frustrated us beyond belief. Although the payment method shows up in the family account, whenever my daughter tries to schedule a ride, the app requests that she scan a credit card to verify. Obviously, she wouldn't have MY credit card on her at school. In addition, we have deleted the app on all of our phones and reinstalled them and for some reason only the App on my daughter's phone allows her to schedule a future pick up. WORST OF ALL, we have yet to be able to speak directly with someone who could help us. When trying to scan the credit card, it takes forever which is crazy. And when it scans the card, the credit card numbers scanned are incorrect and then puts us in a continuous loop asking to scan and verify the credit card. If someone from Uber could assist, they are deliberately avoiding picking up the phone!!!  HELP PLEASE!!!"

A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button!!! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic!!! I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away."

And the app previously had THE best uber pool rates... now, I could take a cab and it would be cheaper (and in NYC that is saying a lot!). Not to mention uberpool pick up time can be as long as a 20min wait compared to the usual 4-5min max wait. This is so disappointing to see such a useful app sink into oblivion.

For example, if I'm a 13 year old kid without an uber account on my phone and my mom needs someone to pick me up. I should have the chance to share my location through \"SMS\" or through \"WhatsApp\" so can my mom could open it on uber just in case she doesn't know the exact location.\n\n-Uber should not charge almost 2 dollars for cancelling 5 minutes after requesting, that's not right. If I don't like the uber that is picking me up, because for some reason the car is broken, the guy seems annoyed, the guy is a creeper..etc. Guys you should take that out for good.\n\n-Uber isn't supposed to be like  other taxi's. Is meant to have a superior quality, in other words, the driver must have qualities that could enrich Uber's image. Uber should make a long quiz for those who want the job, and ask for their ID in case they are banned. If there are at least 3 customers complaining for a specific driver, that driver should be fired. 3 Strikes, you out.\n\n-Uber should correct a bug that makes the driver seem he/she is 15min away, mean while actually he/she is 5min away."

However I would like to profusely complain about the ride notification while you are taking another passenger to a location. Here is the problem. When you were having a conversation with a passenger or watching the road in traffic, it is almost impossible to pay attention to the little banner that comes up at the top of the window notifying you that you have another ride. It would be so much easier for the drivers if the same notification came up like it did for the original ride with the big circle blinking that way we would never miss a ride. Yesterday I missed two rides and for the life of me I have no idea when I got them, please change this immediately so we do not miss any rides and our customers get the quickest pick up. I love driving for Uber and the customers are fantastic."

The app provides tons of great data and information pre trip, during the trip, and post trip which is all great to have. My only complaint is that now instead of an estimation price range, your shown an exact dollar amount but not told very well it's an estimate. So while an estimated ride might be $8 it has always gone way up from that for me. Overall though I enjoy the service (except for that one experience when I turned 21....) and will never use a taxi again."

But it means adding some functionality that may be too much for your slickness obsession.\n\nIf you schedule in advance, you can't choose the kind of ride you want either (I chose economy, but couldn't decline a shared ride)\n\nThis is the second time I've scheduled a ride for someone else. The other time I had no way of telling driver the rider was on north side (it was a large campus).\n\nI tried contacting Uber support, but the folks reading emails are moderately brain dead and seem to be unable to comprehend the complaint/feature request."

Most people don't carry cash anymore.  3) Recently I've had issues with my driver finding where to pick me up and some have asked me to provide them directions to my destination because they said the Uber mapping they use is not reliable.

The second is that every time I tried to split a ride with someone else I get an error stating that Apple Pay cannot be used to share a ride, and gives me no option to choose an alternative payment method. Normally I would not use a review to resolve this kind of issue, but Uber's help desk has been so unhelpful I feel I have no other recourse. Please fix these issues ASAP."

Sorry for the bad new.\n\nHere's a timeline of Uber's troubles so far this year.\n\n- Jan. 28: After President Donald Trump releases his first executive order on immigration, New York taxi drivers protest by refusing to pick up passengers at Kennedy Airport for an hour. Some protesters say Uber tries to capitalize on the protest by picking up passengers anyway, prompting a Twitter protest urging people to delete Uber's app from their smartphones.\n\n- Feb. 2: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quits President Trump's council of business leaders amid mounting pressure from employees and customers over the immigration order.\n\n- Feb. 19: A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, discloses sexual harassment and sexism claims in a blog post about her year at Uber. Fowler says her boss propositioned her and higher-ups ignored her complaints. Kalanick calls Fowler's accusations \"abhorrent\" and hires former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate.\n\n- Feb. 23: Waymo, a self-driving car company spun off from Google, sues Uber. Waymo alleges that Anthony Levandowski - a former top manager for Google's self-driving car project - stole pivotal technology from Google before leaving to run Uber's self-driving car division.\n\n- Feb. 28: A video emerges of Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver. It includes yelling and profanity and ends with a combative Kalanick dismissing the agitated driver's claims that sharp reductions in fares forced him into bankruptcy. In an email to employees, Kalanick admits he needs leadership help. \"I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,\" he says.\n\n- March 3: The New York Times reveals that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber's so-called Greyball software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating Uber's use of the Greyball software.\n\n- March 19: Uber's president, Jeff Jones, resigns less than a year after joining the company. He tells the tech blog Recode that his approach to leadership is at odds with what he experienced at Uber.\n\n- April 18: Sherif Marakby, a global vice president who leads Uber's self-driving car program, leaves the company.\n\n- April 27: Levandowski announces he is stepping aside while Uber defends itself against the allegations from Waymo.\n\n- May 11: A federal judge in San Francisco rejects Uber's request for arbitration and refers Waymo's case to the U.S. Attorney's office for a possible criminal investigation. Days later the judge bans Uber from using technology taken from Waymo, but doesn't order Uber to halt its self-driving vehicle program, as Waymo requested. The case is set for trial in October.\n\n- May 26: Kalanick's mother dies in a boating accident. His father is seriously injured.\n\n- May 30: Uber fires Levandowski.\n\n- May 31: Uber's finance chief Gautam Gupta says he plans to leave the company in July.\n\n- June 6: Uber fires 20 people after a law firm, Perkins Coie, investigates complaints of harassment, bullying and retaliation. That investigation, which was separate from Holder's, checked into 215 complaints; 57 are still under investigation.\n\n- June 11: Uber's board meets with Holder and adopts a series of recommendations based on his report.\n\n- June 12: Emil Michael, Uber's senior vice president for business and a close ally of Kalanick, leaves the company.\n\n- June 13: Kalanick tells Uber employees that he's taking a leave for an unspecified period, but will be available for \"the most strategic decisions.\" Uber's board releases Holder's recommendations, which include removing some of Kalanick's responsibilities and replacing Uber's chairman and founder, Garrett Camp, with an independent chairman. Holder also recommends many cultural and policy changes, from establishing an effective complaint process to recruiting more diverse applicants to prohibiting alcohol and drug use during core work hours."

Might as well try it out since it won't cost you a thing!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

I tried to keep UberX a back up, but I don't like them having location services set to \"Always,\" as opposed to only when I'm using the app. \n\nSo long, Uber.\n\n--Earlier Review--\nThe first time I tried Uber, the driver accepted our fare, then dropped the fare without warning. I finally had to check the app after a few minutes and noticed the dropped fare, and had to set up a new request for another driver to come along. The second driver was just fine but the fact that the first driver just arbitrarily dropped our fare without warning did not give me a positive feeling about the service. Waiting is one thing but waiting for nobody is another.\n\nThe app itself isn't very intuitive, doesn't include any descriptions of the various driving requests (i.e., UberX vs. UberXL, etc.). Competitor products are a bit more simple to use, not nearly as confusing when choosing a ride. I think Uber tries to shove as much as possible into as few a screens as possible, and it makes the app confusing and cluttered. Here in Los Angeles, Uber's pickup times are just not that competitive but are at times a little cheaper than its competitor.\n\nAs an anecdote, I've used their competitor product (rhymes with Sift) in more than a few places across the US, including Los Angeles, Dallas, Denver, and Ft. Lauderdale; each time has been an A+ experience with no hassle. The Uber experience above happened a few weeks ago but I've kept the app along side the \"sift\" app just in case I can get a faster pickup time but after a few weeks, that hasn't been the case so I'm finally deleting it."

And it changes the route and estimated time drastically in the space of minutes.\n\nUber's in-app GPS in Boston is abysmal. For the third time, it has taken a simple, 1/2 mile trip and turned it into a 30 minute odyssey involving highways in rush hour traffic, unnecessary detours across city lines, and no way to alert the company of their screw-up without somehow blaming the driver.  According to the driver, his pay will get dinged if he deviates from their insane directions, so he generally just follows them. Since I don't want him to go unpaid for 30 minutes of work, I am stuck with the bill and a seriously negative impression of Uber as a tech company and as an employer.\n\nFix this, Uber."

Generally better than a cab. I have had one problem driver - crazy guy - but likely no less crazy than some cab drivers I have had. \n\nApp could be easier to use, but it is quite good."

It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

Most of the time we're picking other poolers who are completely off the route and more than a handful of times we've driven past my drop off location to drop off another passenger and driven back down to my drop off location lol I can't believe how often that happens. Their pooling operations is completely stupid . \n\nAlso the pick up eta is horribly off, 1 minute in Uber means 3. So if your pick up time says 5 minutes then that means 15. \nUber is a fraud, though it is cheap, there's a reason behind it. I feel bad for Uber drivers because these rates aren't fair to them and the app service fails on both our end and theirs as well. Shut this app down already."

Making matters worse, they have *removed* the option to use iOS's native privacy controls to allow location tracking only while using the app. Lyft respects users' privacy, unlike Uber. Also, I'm no longer able to rate drivers, since after turning off location tracking there's a nag screen every time one opens or returns to the app, and that nag screen blocks the page where typically one would rate the driver right after a trip (dismissing the nag screen also dismissed the rating screen, which is a major design flaw). Uber has officially gone from hit-and-miss to terrible. And, on top of that, now Uber wants access to your contacts as well as your location. Pass."

That's when I received an \"account disabled\" message for no reason that I can possibly understand.  \"No big deal\", I thought \"I'll just contact customer service\".  Well, it turns out they don't have any.  Instead you submit a form and they will \"contact you\" instead. I waited as long as I could, and nothing. I eventually found a ride after literally begging people. 13 hours had gone by, and still no one had contacted me.  So, I submitted several additional requests for them to contact me. Still nothing, so deleted the app and came here to write about my experience. Now Lyft has me as a new customer."

It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

Uber used to have great customer service and a *good* company. That is no longer true.

I'm sorry it posed such a challenge to the driver. But the real problem was watching him try to drive. As though he had never been in Manhattan. We got out five blocks early to put him out of his misery and now I'll do the same for the whole Uber company by giving Lyft a try."

The new feature that tracks your location even when the app is not in use is just sketchy and also feels very unsafe. The newest feature that will take you to a person by linking your contacts may appear convenient but also sounds super sketchy. I will no longer use Uber unless necessary safety changes are made.

When a driver cancels a booking the app should automatically reassign a new driver under the same fare rate as the original booking. This is an improvements that if not updated in the app program then I will find another service to use. As a current Uber user, I often considering using other book and ride services as Uber is no longer the only option. Also. if a rider cancels a booking after 5 minutes, the rider is charged a cancelation fee which goes to the driver for lost time. If a driver cancels after 5 minutes the rider only receives a notification that the driver has canceled. This penalty structure is unfair. In Qatar, drivers cancel too often. Riders who have lost time due to cancelations by drivers should have a credit to their account which should discount their next trip. This would discourage cancellations from both riders and drivers where not necessary. Uber, you need to be better, not just good enough."

It only allows for the app to see your location always or never, not allowing for \"allow location while app in use.\" If you dont have location tracking, you can't review your driver!\n\n2. By in large there seems to be a consensus that Uber doesn't treat it's drivers well and therefore the drivers take out their Uber-related stresses on the customer. Needless to say this is a HUGE factor against Uber because Uber is not a service but rather a technology and they utilize consenting drivers to do the work for them and exploiting them for their vehicles. I've been scolded by drivers for merely ASKING if I could eat in the car, \"this isn't Uber's car, this is my car\" which is followed by how poorly Uber is to them. This behavior has caused me to not even ask drivers anything. I hesitate to even ask the driver to turn down the volume. One would argue they shouldn't drive but not many drivers would be left and many do this to support a family."

You can be the friendliest passenger but if you're unable to shell out a $10 cash tip you're basically a one star rider. The drivers seem to take passenger ratings very seriously too so if you have a low rating you likely won't get a ride the next time you need one. Uber claims that this system is meant to \"strengthen the community\" but as a longtime passenger it only leaves a very bad aftertaste. To grade paying customers with a point system based on such abstract factors is thoroughly insulting."

For all I know, I'm paying $3.00 a mile while the drivers are being paid $0.85. SHADY!\n\nPlease fire your app development team and start over from scratch. This regression is a bad look for your company. It's very amateur."

To make matters worse the most recent update only allows you to set location to always on or never... the prior versions allowed you to set location while using the app. There's also a problem where a few (1/4) drivers are supposed to show up in one type of car only to show up in a more ratty/older set of wheels. Last point, improve uberpool rider detection, it doesn't make any sense to have to get off the highway, make a huge 15 minute detour to pickup someone else: improve the algorithm. Overall, this version of the app is a big downgrade, takes many steps just to set pickup location (the forced auto detect is often wrong)."

Ive only ever felt uncomfortable with a driver once and the app blocked him from ever picking me up again, which I thought was great. Sometimes Uber is even cheaper than taking the bus in my city.

It takes 30 minutes to go 10 minutes away and that's without using Uber pool. Uber pool yesterday shows me a 9 minute wait for the car which turned into a 45 minute wait. I watch him drive all around broward on the map. When the driver arrives he blamed Uber for the delay. I've sent feedback countless times and every time I get a message saying they've resolved my issue as if they spoke to me and gained agreement that it had been resolved. And the responses are extremely general and impersonal. I would use lyft but their ride sharing is worse than Uber's.

It also seems like they abuse the app update system. Weekly 170MB updates with no change log.

I live on the US, so in one trip to Mexico on 2015 I needed to change the chip of my cellphone to a mexican chip, the problem was that the phone number didnt change so I couldnt reach the driver and he couldnt reach me so I used the regular taxi service. On another trip on Dec 2016 I change the chip as well and I found the option to change the number just during the trip, for some reason I couldnt change it permantly. Because of this, if I forget to change the number during the trip the driver cannot reach me, I think that this part can be improved. But other than that everything is good, at least this last time I was able to change just during the trip."

I had to turn my location service on which was fun since I always have the \"allow location while using app on\" from previous update. My phone started acting weird, it was really hot whenever I use it and the battery just drains like it was no tomorrow. I comb through all of my settings and realized that the new update had the gps location running on my phone the whole time. There is no option to limit the gps it's either on always 24/7 or never. After I turn it off, my phone is back to normal. What a horrible update. They are forcing me to go into my setting every time I want to use this app. How annoying. This is enough to make me use other services. Also not to mention their ridiculous up charges. $21 for a 10 block cab ride!"

My complaint wasn't over $2 by the way, it was over the fact that the driver kept taking wrong turns and I had to cancel because from being 1 minute out he was 10 minutes out and the next ride I got was $10 more expensive than the current ride I had to get. Very disappointed in the customer service. Lyft has 10x better customer service and actually listens to the complaint. Just go with lyft."

I consider the lack of control, despite their claims otherwise, a privacy breach deserving the strongest reaction.

I'll watch the driver switch to google maps or waze and the ETA is always more accurate there.\n\nSecond, the navigation is ungodly bad. I live in NYC. I love watching the little uber cars float across the map when it's confused. Or half the uber route just disappear. Or watch it send the driver in circles back and forth trying to pick me up. Or the app not knowing any of the NYC street rules (bus lanes, no right turns during the day, etc...). I find it hard to believe that there isn't some uber employee in NYC who hasn't used the app and noticed these problems.\n\nAnd last, the app lies to you about how close drivers are. I will request an uber, it'll go to the preliminary screen showing there are 4 drivers nearby and it'll take 5 minutes to get to you...then as soon as I hit confirm and request...the driver will be there in 12 minutes and is on the other side of the city!\n\nI know we've seen recently Uber has been in the news for generally just being a terrible company. I imagine they'll keep that up and not fix any of these issues until users just start to leave the app en masse. But that won't happen because they maintain the bare minimum amount of service to keep you using it. It's sort of analogous to a lousy Manhattan landlord.

        "content": "ETA: Warning: the app is ALWAYS using location, not just \"5 minutes after\" using as Uber says. iOS informed me 2 days after my last app usage, when the app was deliberately closed, that Uber had been using my location in the background, asking me if I want to turn it off. I could not dislike this awful requirement from Uber more or think less about them right now. It works poorly if you don't have location on; trying to remember to remove access for new scummy version of Uber in between uses. The difficulty to do basic tasks especially when not allowing location, has not improved...\n\nOriginal review for this version below...\n\nI've used Uber regularly for years. I could not be more disappointed with the direction they are taking.\n\nThere are two major issues with this app. First, they took a good interface and made it extremely difficult to use. It is clunky, has major issues, and is difficult to do simple things.\n\nBut most importantly, their change to require users to grant them location access ALWAYS and removing the \"when using the app\" option is infuriating. This is a paid service. Google makes their money off my data. Uber gets plenty of data about me, but I also directly pay them every time I ride! There is no reason to force your users to choose between never or always, and make the app extremely difficult to use if I choose never. Access to location when I'm not using the app is battery-draining and privacy-violating. \n\nAlso why is there such a double-standard for driver versus passenger ratings?\n\nLook at your app reviews, and listen to your users. I'm switching to Lyft in any city I can until Uber stops taking its customers for granted."

For example, if I'm a 13 year old kid without an uber account on my phone and my mom needs someone to pick me up. I should have the chance to share my location through \"SMS\" or through \"WhatsApp\" so can my mom could open it on uber just in case she doesn't know the exact location.\n\n-Uber should not charge almost 2 dollars for cancelling 5 minutes after requesting, that's not right. If I don't like the uber that is picking me up, because for some reason the car is broken, the guy seems annoyed, the guy is a creeper..etc. Guys you should take that out for good.\n\n-Uber isn't supposed to be like  other taxi's. Is meant to have a superior quality, in other words, the driver must have qualities that could enrich Uber's image. Uber should make a long quiz for those who want the job, and ask for their ID in case they are banned. If there are at least 3 customers complaining for a specific driver, that driver should be fired. 3 Strikes, you out.\n\n-Uber should correct a bug that makes the driver seem he/she is 15min away, mean while actually he/she is 5min away."

On the first trip, the driver position never changed and we had no idea when the driver would arrive. The estimated wait time jumped up and down, and we had to text the driver to find out if they were even still coming. On the return trip, the driver was waiting across the street when the app indicated they were coming from the other direction so we were looking that way and didn't see them arrive, so they almost gave up and left. After a few minutes of not seeing the driver get closer on the app, we finally looked around and saw them.\n\nUber can no longer be trusted as a reliable platform. Major fail!

I guess if VIP treatment means having to screen shot the application and every single time I request a ride and about to get in the car, or take pics and videos of where and when I get in and out of a car then yea ... VIP. I get charged extra amounts and the excuse from Uber \"customer service\" personnel who respond to your claims is usually that your pick up and drop off location weren't the same as when the ride was requested. First of all, that isn't my business where Uber gps places me. If I leave my home to go to work and both addresses are \"saved\", it is not my fault if the gps picks up another address, or if the driver started or ended the trip before I get picked up or dropped off. It's happened on more than a few occasions. \nMy review isn't going to be all negative, there are some positive however Uber has got to work a lot harder for them. \nWhere do I start? \nLet's get a rating system for Uber transactions and trip reviews, not necessarily rating the drivers who also sort of have their hands tied when it comes to certain things. There are reasons customers may have something to say without impacting a driver's rating. \nUpdates must be made on the routes especially does on Uber pool rides which have often brought me to the same dead end street although I have informed Uber on several occasions. \nUberpool experience with the earlierst and latest drop off time has gotten tremendously better. This helps a customer decide whether or not a pool is a good idea especially when pressed wifh time. \nUber has been charging me a different price other than the upfront fare which is being shown to me and confirmed prior to the trip starting. I have had to write countless emails to Uber for these transactions to be reversed. Just as any other vendor, they take your money right away then tells us to wait 4-5 business days to get it back. Why even bother with an upfront pricing? \nThe drivers, stop hiring so many especially without testing their driving. Safety should come first and unfortunately, some of the drivers leave me with an uneasy feeling through the ride and makes me jump out of the car once I get to my destination."

SHAME ON YOU UBER-not a way to keep someone who before this was a very loyal customer.  I will be scheduling car services to and from the airport from now on, and I travel a lot on business.  I am guessing other customers also feel this way.  I will also be posting this on other review sites and warning my fellow travelers."

I'm not going to recommend this app from Uber. The Uber app pulls the resale value out of your car to Pay YOU. Uber needs to compensate and pay the drives real money, so they can fix and maintain there car's. Uber doesn't pay much to the drivers at all (Uber keeps about 60% of what the rider pay UBER). Once you consider your fuel cost, extremely high cost of ride-share car insurance, car maintenance and the terrible wear and tear on the car itself plus significant lose of value of your car at resale, especially because of the super high miles on your vehicle. The Uber app is a very bad deal for the drive. However the riders are getting a great deal on your dime and time.  Sorry for the bad new.\n\nHere's a timeline of Uber's troubles so far this year.\n\n- Jan. 28: After President Donald Trump releases his first executive order on immigration, New York taxi drivers protest by refusing to pick up passengers at Kennedy Airport for an hour. Some protesters say Uber tries to capitalize on the protest by picking up passengers anyway, prompting a Twitter protest urging people to delete Uber's app from their smartphones.\n\n- Feb. 2: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quits President Trump's council of business leaders amid mounting pressure from employees and customers over the immigration order.\n\n- Feb. 19: A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, discloses sexual harassment and sexism claims in a blog post about her year at Uber. Fowler says her boss propositioned her and higher-ups ignored her complaints. Kalanick calls Fowler's accusations \"abhorrent\" and hires former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate.\n\n- Feb. 23: Waymo, a self-driving car company spun off from Google, sues Uber. Waymo alleges that Anthony Levandowski - a former top manager for Google's self-driving car project - stole pivotal technology from Google before leaving to run Uber's self-driving car division.\n\n- Feb. 28: A video emerges of Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver. It includes yelling and profanity and ends with a combative Kalanick dismissing the agitated driver's claims that sharp reductions in fares forced him into bankruptcy. In an email to employees, Kalanick admits he needs leadership help. \"I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,\" he says.\n\n- March 3: The New York Times reveals that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber's so-called Greyball software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating Uber's use of the Greyball software.\n\n- March 19: Uber's president, Jeff Jones, resigns less than a year after joining the company. He tells the tech blog Recode that his approach to leadership is at odds with what he experienced at Uber.\n\n- April 18: Sherif Marakby, a global vice president who leads Uber's self-driving car program, leaves the company.\n\n- April 27: Levandowski announces he is stepping aside while Uber defends itself against the allegations from Waymo.\n\n- May 11: A federal judge in San Francisco rejects Uber's request for arbitration and refers Waymo's case to the U.S. Attorney's office for a possible criminal investigation. Days later the judge bans Uber from using technology taken from Waymo, but doesn't order Uber to halt its self-driving vehicle program, as Waymo requested. The case is set for trial in October.\n\n- May 26: Kalanick's mother dies in a boating accident. His father is seriously injured.\n\n- May 30: Uber fires Levandowski.\n\n- May 31: Uber's finance chief Gautam Gupta says he plans to leave the company in July.\n\n- June 6: Uber fires 20 people after a law firm, Perkins Coie, investigates complaints of harassment, bullying and retaliation. That investigation, which was separate from Holder's, checked into 215 complaints; 57 are still under investigation.\n\n- June 11: Uber's board meets with Holder and adopts a series of recommendations based on his report.\n\n- June 12: Emil Michael, Uber's senior vice president for business and a close ally of Kalanick, leaves the company.\n\n- June 13: Kalanick tells Uber employees that he's taking a leave for an unspecified period, but will be available for \"the most strategic decisions.\" Uber's board releases Holder's recommendations, which include removing some of Kalanick's responsibilities and replacing Uber's chairman and founder, Garrett Camp, with an independent chairman. Holder also recommends many cultural and policy changes, from establishing an effective complaint process to recruiting more diverse applicants to prohibiting alcohol and drug use during core work hours."

The drivers are also given access to your personal cell phone rather than providing in-app text and voice services.  \n\nWhen drivers cancel at last min, users should be credited for what typically amounts to a 15min delay, which would otherwise be considered poor service.  Meanwhile if you have to cancel because the driver is incompetent and can't find a well-known address, you have to go through a maze of hoops to get a refund.  \n\nAdditionally, there is no simple way to improve basic functions of a ride, such as picking up on the correct side of the street.  You either have to play frogger, or face the drivers wrath in getting a poor rating for making them u-turn.  \n\nI don't care about all the uproar regarding executive stupidity that is happening these days, but the app and service quality is disappointing."

That is, until recently I ordered a ride for my girlfriend and the driver took her outside my apartment and then rather than let her out, decided to detour and go elsewhere for a 20 minute ride despite her asking repeatedly to be let out. Finally, the driver relented and took her back to my address but never told her where she was being taken. If this causes concern for you, it should - this could happen to anyone, not just her.\n\nI wrote multiple support tickets and each time Uber said they apologized that I had a fare issue and hopefully next time would be better. But this wasn't a fare issue, it was a safety issue - they didn't vet the driver thoroughly enough and once informed they made no attempt to rectify it - the driver is still an approved driver and you could match with them the same way my girlfriend did. I called the emergency safety line since that was the only way to get through and was told they'd give me $5 back for the ride, but again, they said this was a fare issue and not a safety issue. \n\nIf any of you have been following Uber in the news this should give you serious pause. Not only is the leadership of the company dodgy when it comes to how they treat women, but that goes down to the way they select their drivers. If you're going to try Uber I suggest being very careful. This ride could easily have become far worse had my girlfriend not gotten out."

A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!

The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

I was charged a fee for cancelling UberPool which I made ONLY because my Uber driver refused to meet me at the location I stated I was at. I understand why they charge cancellation fees but if an Uber driver makes you walk blocks just to accommodate them but keeps driving/changing locations, how is it the customer's fault. A customer shouldn't have to be on the phone for a while just to accommodate a driver who will not meet the passenger but still charges them inappropriately. Lyft is amazing but unfortunately it has higher rates in the city!"

I'm a long time user and very grateful to have Uber available in my city. \n\nHowever, the app has some issues that need to be worked out:\n\n1. Location services options are Always and Never. This causes both privacy concerns and practical concerns (battery life).  For now, I have this set to Never and I just enter my pickup address. \n\n2. The new pickup location pin is confusing. I'm unsure whether the actual pickup location is where I am or at one of the \"convenient\" pickup locations. \n\n3. When I enter an actual pickup address, I would expect that the driver should go to that address. Instead, Uber seems to give the driver directions to a point nearby. \n\nAside from that, I realize many people are unhappy with how the price is now displayed. Instead of informing us of the surge multiplier, we are simply told the cost of the ride. This is really just a psychological issue. Personally, I like the new way better. It seems more like when I purchase anything else. I'm told what the price of the good is and then I can decide whether I want to pay that amount or not get the product. I understand why some people preferred the surge pricing, but I don't think it makes the service any worse."

There are a few people like me out there and I love driving for Uber.  I don't know about that cancel fee.  I would check to make sure he isn't just making sure to say no-show after only a minute or so.  If they are, you need to call and report this one or two drivers.  I don't cancel riders.  I have accidentally missed one or two but then make sure to take it when it shows again.  I haven't done S.F. yet but it sounds like this one person was probably a taxi driver before.  I keep my car clean, offer people mints or gum, if wanted.  I have good conversations with those that want to talk and just listen to music with those that would rather not talk.  I almost automatically give all my riders 5 stars.  Please don't stop using Uber because of one or two idiots that don't know how to be courteous.  I am and know others who are always polite, respectful and care to make sure everyone gets home safely.  It might be the S.F. thing.  Not sure."

The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

I've heard great things about it so I figured I'd give it a try. I've now spent over two hours trying to just get a trip. First it won't accept my credit card for a method to schedule a trip (even though it saves it as a method of payment). Then when I tried to input my PayPal account it tells me that it's not accepting that method, \"method of payment invalid\". I am even currently logged into that PayPal account in another window so the info and account are good! Then when trying to get help or contact somebody there is very limited choices on how to contact anyone. It seem only to refer you back to articles for pre-existing problems. It took me more than 15 minutes to find out how to reach them (can't use the app.) after using a desktop computer. Then it seems the only way to contact Uber, is through email. Which you first have to confirm through some verification method and if you don't respond in 24 hours that gets canceled out. After all that, now I have to wait to try to get help and my flight is in six hours and I still haven't went to sleep yet!\nI can't remove my credit card method of payment without adding another method of payment which of course it's not allowing me to add my PayPal. If I did not know that this was a known company I'd swear this was a scam to list all of my credit card payment option so they can gain access to them!\nLyft just let me do all the same stuff in 5 min. Now I gotta see if I can get my Groupon refund since I can use this stupid Uber service."

Enter it right before you request a ride in the promotions tab. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing! The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

Enter it right before you request a ride in the promotions tab. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing! The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button!!! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

You can have an incredibly accurate, reliable app with the \"Only While Using\" location services option. \n\nThe only real reason I can see for this is Uber wants to track user movements and sell the analytics to the highest bidder, which is deplorable."

Well when I request an Uber it'll show $3.99 while I'm on the trip it'll show $3.99 but once the trip is completed it'll be triple that price a few times even more, once it was $43.00.  And I'll email them and they'll give me every excuse in the book for the price increase. And its sad because they used to be a good honest company but when this ride pass expire I might have to cancel my account. I just hope the correct this problem."

Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!!"

Uber is my only way home after work and it might just make me broke. Great app of course but really would appreciate the old pricing again even if it's a late night. Not fair for us who are working hard late nights and having to pay an hour or two worth of work to get home."

Not just for privacy but also to preserve battery life. \n\nSetting it to never. Now that I have to enable location before I can use the app, then disable after I use the app, I suspect I'll just use Lyft instead. More convenient. \n\nThinking that's not what Uber was going for with the update, but should have thought this one through a little better."

I spent twenty minutes with two different cards trying to get the app to call a driver but it just kept asking for card information. I had tried uber once before when I was in florida on vacation also and I ended up getting charged $5 because the trip got canceled when the wrong driver came up and told us we have to cancel the trip because he couldn't fit us. App is clunky you can only do one destination, long wait time- will never use it again. Put it this way- if you want to deal with a horrible app and maybe get a ride use it. Otherwise learn from my frustration and troubles and use Lyft!"

The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

Last week, i used uber for the first time and since i was referred by my wife i received a $20 credit. We were in the city and decided we want to take a uber back home. I opened the app to check for prices. I saw that it would cost $52.09 to get home from where we were at. However, when my wife opened her app (at the same time standing right next to me), the price on her app says $46.05. Since, i had the $20 credit we decided i would book the ride. I found this fare discrepancy to be unfair and maybe even unlawful. We were hailing a car at the same time, same location, to the same destination so why is the price on my app higher(by more than 10%)? I took screenshots on both of our phones in hoping that uber will honor the lower price however all they have done is offer up more excuses. They told me that supply and demand, time of day, traffic conditions and construction can all affect pricing and i don't have problem with that explanation except we were standing at the same location, go to the same destination at the same time. That makes no sense to me. I ask everyone to test this out for themselves. Honestly, i think maybe uber mark up my price because of the $20 credit they gave me which they don't disclose and will never admit to..."

Before Uber came to my area I was forced to rely on our local taxi service which is extremely unreliable as well as extremely expensive. In all my travels I only had one issue and customer service took care of it immediately. I can honestly say even if you choose not to use the promo code I gave above you should definitely give Uber a try. For those who do use the coupon I greatly thank you. I use the referrals I received from it for situations such as when I am required to work late and the buses have stopped running."

        "content": "I am extremely frustrated with my entire experience with Uber this past month. On Dec 30, 2016, I left my iPhone 7 in an Uber drivers car. I immediately called the Uber driver on the morning of Dec 31st and left a voicemail explaining the situation with a number to get back to me on. I called every day since then for a total of 35 times, all of which never resulted in an answer or call back. Meanwhile, I had been emailing Uber explaining the situation. On Jan 4th, Uber emailed me letting me know they got a hold of the driver who would be dropping off the phone. On Jan 6th, uber emailed me saying: \"Your driver mentioned that he already dropped the item in our Greenlight Hub. However, your driver was worried that the item might not be logged properly under his name.\" I wrote back asking what this even meant and if Greenlight Hub had my phone available for pick up. I never got a straight answer as to whether or not the phone was at the Atl hub or not. They continued to write back to me stating they were trying to contact the Atlanta office and that they would get back to me with a case number once they figured out who he left the phone with and where exactly it was. In multiple emails they write: \"We don't currently provide phone support in Uber Greenlight hub in and we still don't have a case number in order for you to claim the item.\" They basically stated the phone could not be picked up without a case number. \n\nThese back and forth emails continued for 3 weeks up until January 24. At this time, I was thinking that although the driver stated he had the phone and would drop it off, that he was ignoring my voicemails and calls and was lying to Uber to keep the phone. When about to go to my local police office to file a stolen phone report, I did a final repeat call to the driver to see if there was any possible hope that he would answer so that I could figure out if my phone was dropped off or if it was still in his possession. At that time, he did finally answer, after 3.5 weeks of me calling, and stated he dropped the phone off at the Atlanta hub the day after Uber contacted him saying there was a phone left in his car. So sometime between January 4-January 24 the phone was dropped off at the hub office. I would have been more than happy to have drove to the Atl hub to pick up the phone when it was dropped  off; however, Uber never confirmed with me that the phone was there. \n\nThankfully, the Uber office did have my phone and I was able to get it back. \n\nI am extremely frustrated with this entire process. I spent $700 to purchase a new phone and had to go through the hassle of buying a new phone and loosing all my information on my original phone. I never got a direct answer about whether or not the driver had even dropped off the phone at the hub office. There was no number I could call to speak with a person directly rather than back and forth emails between multiple Uber employees, all of which never contacted me letting me know that the phone was available for me to pick up. \n\nI am a loyal customer to Uber because I truly do love your service, but the way this situation was handled has changed my views. I'm sure that it's hard for the Uber employees emailing to communicate with the Atl office employees since they were not in the same building as where the phone was, but I continued to get the run around in emails. I wanted to provide my feedback in hopes that the process can somehow be fixed so that other people do not have to go through a huge ordeal, similar to my situation, to retrieve their lost items."

I am a regular uber rider, often riding two times a day every week, and twice just today and yesterday my uber drivers wrong choices and poor navigational instructions have either added twenty minutes to my ride and made me late to work or caused us to cross a busy bridge back and forth twice both ways!!!

It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

I don't know why I'm writing this here but I feel like if someone was to ever see this, they could tell my story. I don't know where else to write or what to do right now. Did I hear a pig sound? \nI'm calling 911.\n\nEdit2: the cops came yet the house was empty. They told me to lay low and just chill that I probably imagined it. They did now however hear any pig sounds. I feel like tonight might be my last, I'm not sure how to sleep while I can feel the pigs head breathe over my head. I can't see anything but it all could be just some fear of the dark, and some stress I've been having lately.\nBut why would I imagine a pig sound? \nI will write an edit 3 in the morning. If I don't.\n..."

Today the app showed the car would be at my house within 8 min and 20 min later changed out the driver for someone else that would be there in 8 min. The second driver arrived around 10-15 min after so in total I waited over a half hr for the car and missed my meeting. \n\nThe app crashes often and the Uber's customer support is nonexistent now that the telephone number has gone away. I've been charged for rides I didn't take and it takes me longer to ask for the reimbursement than it's with. They now track you even when you're not using the app which is a major security problem and should just be outlawed to only give never or always track. \n\nIt's sad to say it but I am ready to try another ride app. I hope they are better!"

So you can never see when the Surge is happening. Just have to pay close attention to the price they quote. What happen to a warning of increased pricing and having the option to be notified when it is over? Instead of making the app better Uber is just finding ways to be more sneaky!"

I've seen how the driver app works and I know you do not have to accept the request. Luckily, I've never been late for work. Coming from work I've had instances where the driver went the wrong direction and blamed me. Told me to cancel and I got charged $10!!! I am low income where of the driver cancel, it would have charged him $5. Then was rude to me and hung up! It gets a 3.5 because when I'm in LA it has been reliable and has car pool, but when I need it for work, probably 40%. I only recommend Uber for heavy populated areas or big cities and metropolises. Hometowns, small towns, etc...not much reliability."

Might as well try it out since it won't cost you a thing!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!!

Might as well try it out since it won't cost you a thing!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

        "content": "Uber is a ridesharing app for fast, reliable rides in minutes—day or night. There's no need to park or wait for a taxi or bus.\n\nIf you’ve heard of Uber, then you’ve likely heard something about an Uber promo code, which grants new users crazy amounts of free ride credit when they sign up for the app for the very first time.\n\nIf you still haven’t used the app, you’re in luck. There’s never been a better time to become an Uber user than now, so cash in on this promotion while it lasts.\n\nFrom what our research indicates, applying the Uber credit code “70kks” to your account before you take your first ride is one of the best ways to get a discounted first ride. After applying this Uber promo code for new users, you will see a free ride credit pop up in your account.\n\nWhile the amount of free credit is currently $15, we’ve seen it jump up even higher than that on some occasions. But our advice is to just apply the promotion and request a ride, because once you apply the credit, it is good for 30 days.\n\nApplying an Uber promo code\n\nA $15 Uber credit will get you almost anywhere you need to go for free, or at worst, put a significant dent in your final fare and save you $15. We use $15 credits all the time and they get our team pretty far, no matter what city we are visiting.\n\nActually applying an Uber credit code is easy, and can be done in a few simple steps:\n\nDownload the Uber App – You can get it from the Google Play or App Store\nSelect Promotions Tab – Head on over to the tab labeled “Promotions”, then tap Add Promo Code\nEnter Uber Promo Code – Enter the promo code in the box, then tap Apply\nThree easy steps and you’re on your way. If you’re having trouble, however, see the tutorial below that walks you step-by-step through the Uber rider signup process."

Go to the Payment tab in the app and enter the coupon under promotions. Might as well try it out since it won't cost you a thing!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

The app froze on me when I tried to select a Payment and then when I closed out the app, it had scheduled a ride in a totally different location. Then I had to cancel after talking to the Uber driver on the phone for at least 5 minutes. Thank goodness they refunded me after complaining. Then the second Uber came and went in what seemed like a \"normal\" interaction only to find the ride did not terminate after arriving at the airport. I checked my bag before the app said the ride was over. What is going on???? Uber is getting slower and slower. Four minute pick ups have become 10 minute pick ups as drivers circle around and around trying to get to the location. It's very frustrating to see quality declining. This review has been after months of declining satisfaction. My usual Uber network is Washington D.C., so my issues are not just limited to Miami."

It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic.

There is no option to add an alternate #. So when I tried to update my number it made me verify & then kept giving me a user error/ unable to save. So when I tried to create a new acct on the OS phone, it told me the # was already associated with another acct & to contact customer service. Which I did - repeatedly! You can only email them. I emailed the issue, got an email back saying please provide screen shots. When I hit the reply button like stated & submitted the screen shots I would get an email back saying: the email your replying from doesn't match the email of the original!!!! I went thru this like 10 times! Utter frustration. To the point I stopped using the service bc I had to carry around 2 phones just to use their service! My daily OS phone to set the pickup AND the American phone to contact/ or be contacted by the driver! Ridiculous! They need a better system. \n\nThey also need to stop drivers from rating you poorly if you don't tip as the service encourages. If I'm clean, where I said I was & not high maintenance why are the drivers not giving 5 stars? Oh because they wanted a tip. One of my drivers told me I had a poor rating & suggested I tip better. I'm very disappointed with all this."

On top of that, they make you pay to cancel a ride. I have heard that many of the cars in the map view are fake, just to entice you into ordering a car which you think will arrive much sooner than it actually will.\n\nTo sum up: this company lures you in by falsely claiming there are fast rides in the area, the sticks you with a ride that's 10 min out, then makes you pay to cancel it if you can't wait that long. This is honestly borderline fraudulent behavior and I am surprised this company has not yet been caught doing it..."

        "content": "I still can not understand why Uber won't let you mark your destination using a pin rather than entering an address. It makes no sense. \n\nWhile traveling within the US where the street addresses are pretty good, it's not a problem. None the less dropping a pjn would be nice. \n\nNow, traveling in other countries is not easy at all most of the time.\n\nHere's what I am talking about. The app let's you use a pin to mark your pickup location. It even lets you move that pin around. But it does not do the same for the destination. Making it impossible to often enter a destination location.\n\nI'm visiting Mexico often. I know the streets and locations of places I want to go to but I can't using uber. Even when I have the address of the place, most often it can not find the place if you enter the address. I know where it is on the map but can't drop a pin. It really is frustrating!\n\nAddresses there are not easy to understand. For example, a friend owns a luxury apartments in a Tijuana's wealthy neighborhood. His gas bill as one address, his electric bill as another, and his cable bill as yet another. All for the same place. That is crazy! And guess what, I can enter all three address in Google maps or in this app and nothing comes up.\n\nThe developers of this app need to fix that ASAP! Seriously! Dropping pins for destinations is a must in some situation.\n\nLyft allows you to move the destination pin on the map and that is one of the reasons why when I travel I use it more than Uber. Unfortunately, it only lets you do it in Lyft Line. The equivalent of Uber pool. Both services need to address that issue and educate customers on how to use the app. As a driver I've had this conversation with many Lyft passengers and all tell me that it would be very useful. I imagine Uber passengers would like the same feature."

Before Uber came to my area I was forced to rely on our local taxi service which is extremely unreliable as well as extremely expensive. In all my travels I only had one issue and customer service took care of it immediately. I can honestly say even if you choose not to use the promo code I gave above you should definitely give Uber a try. For those who do use the coupon I greatly thank you.

There's no more option to allow reading location only when the app is running. You told that you need location info within 5 minutes after ride. No, there's no reason I want to share that, and there's no reason I trust you that you only collect what you promised. I have disabled location sharing on this app. Doesn't that make the app practically unusable? Yes. But not that I'm going to care because I'll never use this service again. I just keep this app installed so every time it is updated, I'll come and post a 1-star review. And seemingly you are attempting to wash out all these negative reviews by updating this app every a few days. I'll tell you that won't work. You'll only remind more people leaving a negative review."

He tried to use the services u offer drivers like help on insurance and repairs if u get into a wreck or go into a ditch in winter like my husband did. Thee is suppose to be help with repairs but when called u said no help. U head honchos need to read all the negAtive reviews, and there are many, I'd say out of 10 reviews, 9 are bad. How can u head honchos not care whet your customers and drivers are saying?? I'm sure it's all about money to u guys but remember no customers, no money!!! Don't think that won't happen losing lots of customers because u will. People say enough is enough. You've broken privacy rules, and all sorts of things I've read. People leaving uber is real!!! It's happening u no good leaders!!!  Also when a driver gets a crown or whatever it is for 500 5star ratings, give them something like free gas or a gift card, something good for their hard work they r doing for your company. I hope this message gets to the right person to get these matters worked out. When customers and drivers are happy with Uber's services, uber grows and grows in a good and positive way. I also hope all uber customers drivers, and all workers for uber read this and keep sending powerful messages to Uber's head honchos! Someone reads these reviews for uber and whoever they are please HELP😊 thank u so much           \n\nFrom: 😇angel in your corner"

I know longer have to worry about getting rides from airports to home, or from the car servicing place back home, or trying to get around a new city. So much better and convenient then taxis and local transport. I don't have to do any pre-planning or look up info about the transports available. I just whip out my phone and get me a ride to wherever I need to go. Also, feel so much safer since I can immediately send a link to a friend/family that can track my ride! Love it."

Enter it right before you request a ride in the promotions tab. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing! The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

I looked through all my emails from uber, I didn't receive any warning about this.

I even tried to register a new account using my secondary phone number and email, but the app refused to accept my payment. It wouldn't scan my card, gave me an error when I typed the info in manually, and won't even let me use my PayPal. Absolutely awful. Looks like I'm staying home tonight."

The app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again. The customer support is also fantastic!!! I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

        "content": "First of all, if you haven’t taken a ride yet make sure you use the coupon ‘as10369ue’ to get $20 off your first ride! Enter it right before you request a ride in the promotions tab. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing! The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

You only need to know where I am when I need to order a Uber.

        "content": "UPDATE 2: As others have pointed out, Uber is likely pushing new updates just to clear out the bad reviews. They're hoping people will lose interest after a while and they can get away with their deceptive privacy practices unchecked.\n\nUPDATE: It looks like Uber was forced to remove the obvious lie from their app description, but with this version of the app they still can monitor your location at all times--not just when you've used Uber recently. And what about all the people who allowed the app to monitor their location because they believed the lie? The latest \"feature\" described in this update shows Uber never intended to keep that promise even for a second. Shame on them.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI'm an iOS developer and the  description about how they'll use your location information is simply not true. With this configuration not only can they monitor your location for up to 5 minutes after you use the app, but also for up to 5 minutes *practically any time they want*, whether you've used the app or not.\n\nAdditionally, apps that monitor your location all the time are one of the bigger causes of battery drain, even on newer devices.\n\nTo the developers:\n\nJust be honest--you're yet another company who wants to snoop in on where people go and make a few extra bucks selling that information to the highest bidder. Many people will use the app anyway.\n\nThe really irritating thing is that you easily could have left the original option (to get location info only while the app is being used) so that tech savvy people could change it in Settings. Instead you chose to explicitly remove that option and try to force people to accept something that benefits you at the expense of their batteries. Deleted. If you want my business you'll have to bring the option back. Aside from Lyft, there are still plenty of cabs in D.C. and thanks to the competition the cabs are much better than they used to be."

Enter it right before you request a ride in the promotions tab. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing! The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

I've had my account locked 7 times in 1 month. Every time a rep unlocks it and apologizes, another customer service rep feels the need to go back into the system and re-lock the account. Their service reps have zero form of communication with each other. This is why multiple reps seem to answer questions with scripted responses.

When Uber says that people can leave cash tips that safety aspect goes out the door, mainly for the driver. A cashless experience is what we all deserve.\n\nBecause of this I always use Uber last when I need a Lyft somewhere. If they were to implement a tipping option it would be my first. Until then..."

It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

Enter it right before you request a ride in the promotions tab. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing! The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

Go to the Payment tab in the app and enter the coupon under promotions. Might as well try it out since it won't cost you a thing!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

And 55 minutes to return. Uber only payed me 46.00 dollars. I've been trying to reach them over the phone for 2 days.  I have had no luck getting any representation to help me. I have been also texting them. They ignore my question completely.  according to uber , we are going to make between 10-30 dollars an hour. This trips adds up to 129.00 dollars. I only got paid 46.00. Nobody has reached out to me. My eight hours working for uber has payed me $ 4.35 an hour . After all my expenses. I have brought everything to there attention, and they still continue to ignore me. I believe and trusted them. I've been lied to and ignored , I feel destroyed and disrespected by them. I feel I was taken advantage from them. They know what there doing. And I'm ambarresed to have allowed myself to be taken advantage of in such a way. I never thought that we were going back into a time of slavery. In fact it's worst , It's not just that uber did not pay me what I deserved, but that I had to pay it out of my pocket, for services that they offer. There a 2.8 stars in the apple add. According to uber rules and regulations. They cannot go under 4 stars . And there a 2.8 . Uber please pay me what you owe me. That's all I want . Thank you. Have a good day.

Go to the Payment tab in the app and enter the coupon under promotions. Might as well try it out since it won't cost you a thing!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

These are important for users because changes and new features can affect how we use the application. If the release notes say nothing except \"Thanks for using the app, we update regularly, blah, blah, blah...\" then I have no idea what the changes are.\n\nIt's not that hard to write good release notes. Just list any new features and visible changes. These can be brief, but must indicate clearly to the user what has changed. Then, indicate if there were bug fixes and, optionally, what they were. Not every bug needs a specific note, but if it was a major bug, it's best to mention it so that users know it's been fixed. Finally, add news, general information, and marketing copy as desired. This is the least important part, and developers should be careful not to be so creative that they detract from the usability and readability of the release notes, but a little flair isn't a bad thing.\n\nBecause of the lack of release notes, I've given this application one star. I hope the developers can see the value of release notes and start providing them for the benefit of their customers. Release notes are not optional; they're possibly the single most important way to communicate with your customers. Use them properly and your users will thank you for it."

After updating the app (iPhone 7+) the local offers section is now missing! Contacting support through the app help section is a nightmare. I have to complain about a recent ride just to be able to voice my issues. Apparently Uber no longer has an email support option which is a terrible idea. I've wasted a lot of money targeting restaurants to dine at in attempt to earn points and am still waiting on Uber to contact me. Fix your app and allow customers to be able to contact you by email. The app does not work \"seamless\" and has one of the worst help section platforms of any app I know of. For those who have their local offers working - do not update your app. It will disappear. I have tried 2 devices."

I've tried pinning on nearby streets and that hasn't helped. The way I understand it, the driver doesn't actually see the pin's location, they just get directions to the nearest generated address, which of course may be significantly off. But it gives the user the idea that the pick up location is precise, which is false (and leads to avoidable frustration). The pin feature only makes sense when there are no nearby landmarks and when the roads are spread out. There needs to AT LEAST be the OPTION to be able to search for the pick up location via name or address. Sometimes all a driver needs to know is \"Marriott\" or \"Target\" and it clears up 99% of any confusion. PLEASE take this into consideration for the next updates."

Go to the promotions tab on the app and enter the coupon there. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing!!!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

Instead of supporting this brave action, which had nothing to do with monetary gain for the drivers and everything to do with preserving and honoring the fabric of this society, Uber canceled surge pricing to break the strike. Uber is not only anti labor, anti union, and apparently anti immigrant (despite many of their drivers being immigrants and green card holders themselves, significant numbers of them Muslim and some from the countries listed in the ban), they have showed themselves to be anti compassion, anti decency, and anti-integrity."

This is just stupid Uber. \n\nI suggest you try some of excellent alternatives.  Most of the same exact drivers work for the alternatives too, but without the troubling personal privacy practices offered by Uber.  And most alternatives, I have learned, are less expensive. \n\nOriginal Review: \nSince the app and service are tightly coupled, my review is for both. \n\nOverall, very good. Generally better than a cab. I have had one problem driver - crazy guy - but likely no less crazy than some cab drivers I have had. \n\nApp could be easier to use, but it is quite good."

        "content": "First of all, if you haven’t taken a ride yet make sure you use the coupon “zge3ui\" to get $20 off your first ride! Enter it right before you request a ride. Go to the Payment tab in the app and enter the coupon under promotions. Might as well try it out since it won't cost you a thing!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

        "content": "Do not update. \n\nPrivacy: Broken with new location choices of only \"Always\" or \"Never\". \n\nBattery: Killed. (See above location settings.)\n\nDanger Level: Sky high. \nFirst of all, to save battery while out, you have to turn location off because Ubers GPS kills a full charge (iPhone 6) in 3 hours of on-use. So now when you leave a place, on the street that you don't know, you open Uber. But location is off (they removed the \"While using app\" location setting option), so now Uber doesn't know where you are so you can't request a ride. This is dangerous and stupid. The options for location in system settings should always include a \"While using app\" setting -- if not I usually delete the app. \n\nRider Centered: Broken. \nCan't request a ride until you type a location, which you may not yet know exactly; like when you say \"Let's go downtown. I'll call an Uber.\" and then you decide between spot A or B, or look it up, or get the address from friends you're meeting. It is not at all odd to not know an exact address right when you request. The new system just does not match what actual riders do.\n\nAlso see above about location. This is an example of moving away from \"rider centered\".\n\nUber now attempts to force riders to walk to \"nearby convenient pickup locations\" rather than where the h*ll you are. Nearby convenient locations for drivers to pick up waiting riders already has an app...it's called a Bus Stop!\n\nOverall this update is very much a step backward for Uber. \n\nDo not update if you value your time, your payment settings, your actual safety, your ease of requesting a ride, your battery, the accuracy of maps."

Also, I'm no longer able to rate drivers, since after turning off location tracking there's a nag screen every time one opens or returns to the app, and that nag screen blocks the page where typically one would rate the driver right after a trip (dismissing the nag screen also dismissed the rating screen, which is a major design flaw).

I have to act as if I am go to go from one point to another before I can see other drivers in close proximity of a certain circular area. \n\nThe people who are ranting about the Uber experience shouldn't, in my estimation, be bemoaning their experience here. If I mam correct this is where we write concerning the app. \n\nNow to answer those who have bemoaned:\n\nAs a driver I have many concerns but you would do well to do a support ticket to address those issues rather than here. If one support person does not answer your needs ask to raise it to the next level. \n\nAs a driver, I ask if my customer if they have a preferred route. Or if they want to bring it up on their device and give me turn by turn instructions. Your are paying so you have the right and responsibility to tell us what you want. If using GPS, which is not under Uber's total responsibility, remember it is what it is. If you see or hear something wrong then speak up and do it before we get to a point where we cannot remedy it until we have to use another route. \n\nAs for cancellations, there are some that want to be \"The Cancellation King.\" (See YouTube)\n\nOn another note our riders do put in current location and it puts us somewhere else than where they are or want to be picked up. If you know that GPS always puts drivers other than where you want then text or call your driver well ahead of time so they know there will be an issue. Or move the map so it is more precise, rather than the back of your dwelling. \n\nRiders should be ready and outside so we don't lose money waiting. Some drivers feel that if you are taking away our income by making us wait then you deserve to be charged on other way around. Let's all be responsible to each other. Be as visible as safely is possible. Some believe that if you make us wait more than 5 minutes you deserve  to learn the hard way. If you make us wait you should be required to pay a cancellation fee. Also you will have to request and wait for another Uber, who will be further away from you than the current one was.   \n\nWhen you see that your driver is 2 minutes away you should be outside waiting. All of your group should be outside waiting together. If you ask for an UberX don't have 5 passengers. If you are under 18 and don't have a person over 18 with you then you cannot ride Uber.\n\nDon't put us in the position of having to cancel your ride. If I am already close to your area then be ready to come out immediately. There are times in the city where my last stop was at your very location. You should see that on the map before you request a ride. If you are not ready than wait till you are to request a ride. Or tell the driver they can start the ride while they wait for you. \n\nThese are just some common helpful instructions. Take what you want. Be helpful and responsible and then maybe we wouldn't have the issues you have been having. It's your ride take control of it.\n\nPlease remember to have cash to tip. Or ask if you can tip by using PayPal."

Go to the promotions tab on the app and enter the coupon there. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing!!!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!!

When I tried to cancel Google maps, it warned me I might be charged.  No customer service phone number for Uber, only a basic online form which sent email and blamed my phone carrier for blocking short SMS verification!   Abhorrent.

It can be seen on the uber app that rides are making me later for my events. They know what they're doing but they don't care. When uberpool first came out, it was relatively direct, they didn't take you for bad roundabout pickups, and they let you cancel if your driver is late.\n\n I may still have to use this app under some circumstances for lack of alternatives, but I will be avoiding it where I can."

        "content": "I have been suing Uber for a number of years and initially it was a game changer. For years I have complained about taxis turning up late, their cars being unclean, their ride drivers etc.\n\nSo when Uber came along I though this was the answer. As a regular traveller I have used Uber in cities all over the world and until the last 6 months my praise could not be high enough. But recently standards have started to fall. All of the complaints I have had about taxis I now have for Uber. I suspect their biggest problem is that they've just got too big and cannot control he quality whilst they still have to meet their continued growth targets.\n\nIssues I've had include drivers taking other passengers and i still receive the charge. Drivers calling me telling me they have another job (not sure how they're assigned to me then) and they cannot tell when they will pick me up so I should cancel and book another (so I would incur a fee that they would receive, when they can also cancel, but refused to do so). I've also had the usual dirty car, ride driver, clueless driver (no idea what traffic signs mean) and dangerous drivers. The pickup locations also make no sense - i have tried to change the pickup location on the map, contact the drivers in advance... anything I can but the drivers will not turn up at my address. Instead I constantly have to walk 400 yards around the corner to meet the drivers - several times getting soaked in the rain. \n\nMy biggest complaint however is the customer service. Just try making a compliant. The response is unbelievable - often making no sense. They REFUSE to answer questions even when you are specific. There is no option to raise a complaint or ask for assistance ahead of a driver arriving. So if you're stood waiting three times the quotes time there is nothing you can do other than cancel and pay a fee. If someone else gets in your car - again nothing you can do until the journeys over and they've taken money out of your account.\n\nI'm sad to say I'm going to give other services a try. I'm not expecting anything different but Uber's response to my complaints and basic questions has been absolutely shocking."

I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!

I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

He yells \"where are you??\" And I said I was still in the parking lot of the requested address. He said to stop calling this number and hung up. After that he rejected all my calls. \n\nWhen I contacted Uber support they said \"due to my account history\" they couldn't refund me the money. When I asked for documentation about it, they couldn't provide it. I sent them screenshots of my location TIMESTAMPED. Clear evidence that I wasn't on the trip. They didn't even acknowledge it and kept sending me the same canned response. I was determined though and kept asking to speak to a supervisor and eventually they said \"we will not see eye to eye and are closing this discussion.\" How absurd. It's not even the money at his point it's the principle. Uber just STOLE money from me and didn't do anything about it. \n\nDo you want this kind of treatment? Do you want Uber to take your money and do nothing about it? Do you want to arrive late to where you're going and get completely frustrated about it? Then sure, install the app. \n\nIf not, take lyft. Anything really is better than this garbage. Public transportation is much better."

Enter it right before you request a ride in the promotions tab. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing! The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

Uber needs to compensate and pay the drives real money, so they can fix and maintain there car's. Uber doesn't pay much to the drivers at all (Uber keeps about 60% of what the rider pay UBER). Once you consider your fuel cost, extremely high cost of ride-share car insurance, car maintenance and the terrible wear and tear on the car itself plus significant lose of value of your car at resale, especially because of the super high miles on your vehicle. The Uber app is a very bad deal for the drive. However the riders are getting a great deal on your dime and time. Sorry for the bad new. Thank you."

The past few days, when I have tried to book a trip, all I can see is a map of the world when I zoom out and I'm unable to book. There's no way to give general feedback.

        "content": "I'm only giving uber a 3 star rating because I'm just now starting to have issues, and I will most definitely be looking for other car options instead of uber.\n\nAs soon as I thought uber would suffice my travel needs, they begin to charge me more than what they said they would.  And I'm not talking $2... I'm talking almost $10!!  Plus their customer service is only by email which allows them to hide behind a computer and give generic answers instead of caring enough to adequately solve the issues.  At this point I give uber 2 thumbs down and I hope for a better car service option soon. If anyone has a direct number to reach an actual uber rep over the phone - please post!  \n\nBeware of extra charges when you ride uber!!!!!"

Go to the Payment tab in the app and enter the coupon there under promotions. Might as well try it out since it won't cost you a thing!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

Or the app keeps saying there are no cars available, then would send a car without notifying me, drivers press no show and I keep getting charged an extra $5 not even knowing there was a driver waiting for me! Which FYI they do not refund, they give you a \"credit.\"  This has happened numerous times this week. \nUber go back to your old version or I'm officially switching to Lyft!

It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

        "content": "I have been using Uber for 4 months and MOSTLY it was issue-free until recently. I just realized that drivers do not know where you are going until they pick you up. I have had drivers flat-out tell me they don't want to take me because it is too far or they are lazy (seriously one told me that, how the heck did he get a 4.8 star rating). So, I get slapped with a charge and they make some money off my demise. It's ridiculous. Really Uber should display where their customers want to go to avoid unnecessary pain. I know Uber says it will make drivers cherry pick, but they should find some other way to fix this issue."

Enter it right before you request a ride in the promotions tab. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing! The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring back the image and color of car preview!!! Also, location mapping is horrible! I can't choose where I need to be picked up. My gps is always off leads to my uber picking me up a block away from where i actually am. Not cool. \n\nAs for location tracking whatever, i don't really care. But not cool. I feel like my parents are tracking me like they were in high school! plus what're you even doing with that information!?"

I waited another 5 minutes and the app showed then that \"I had arrived\" so they charged me! I waited a little longer hoping that the driver was still going to show up, but it didn't happen! I reported this to Uber Support, worried that this guy would do the same to other people, and they answered me with a fits-all kinda email saying that \"they have reason\" to believe I did take the ride! And the conversation when on until I got tired of explaining the situation! I even sent proof! But it was pointless! I can't take seriously a business that doesn't have a decent customer service!

A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

I tried to set up a ride when I got to a city in north cal but it made me waste half an hour because whenever I tried selecting my payment method for my ride it either said, \"unable to access account\" or if I put my card info right on the site, it wouldn't let me. Uber needs to focus on updating its technical areas more than updating the looks of the app. I went on Lyft and it let me set up a ride with basically one click and with no problem. So lyft is better for me."

Lyft is only 27mb, Uber is most likely that big because it's most likely tracking everything you do on your phone. Lastly all these reviews talk about bad customer service, usually they're fast and work with me to find solutions when I have issues. No problem there."

The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

He said he didn't even want to have sex with her after the 3rd time but did it anyway. All of us in the car were visibly uncomfortable and I even made a sarcastic remark about him \"not\" being a rapist. I've heard stories about how Uber will continue to employ sexually aggressive/ rapist drivers but I've never felt more relieved to get out of a car, and also never more afraid of someone knowing where I live. Cherry topper, he tried to write his wrong by telling us a story about how he stopped a rape by jumping on a mans back and not calling the police. I will never EVER use this Uber, I'd rather walk!"

        "content": "Here's my message to Uber:\n\"My Saturday night turned into a disaster trying to get an Uber ride. I was in downtown San Jose the night of 3/4/17 when I called my first Uber at 10:53pm. I didn't realize it at the time, but apparently the app put my \"current location\" on the opposite side of the block (with buildings in between so I couldn't just walk over there). And the drivers were plentiful in that area so I couldn't have walked there fast enough anyways. So my first driver, Antonio, went where the app had my location and I obviously wasn't there, so he canceled my trip (without texting or calling me which is frustrating). The app notified me that my trip was canceled. So I request the ride again at 10:57pm. This time I notice the location was incorrect, so I called my driver, Hironmoy, and explained that I was on the opposite side of the block on 1st Street in front of the Continental. He said okay, but then went to the wrong spot anyways. Then he called and asked where I was. I explained again my location and that the app had it wrong. I don't think he could understand me so he canceled my trip. Now I'm getting frustrated. So I call for the trip a third time at 11:08pm, this time manually typing in the address of the building I was standing in front of. Unfortunately Hironmoy was my driver again. I watched him drive past me 2 times!!! He just never even stopped...he was making laps around the block. So watching the app, I was prepared to basically run in front of him and flag him down on his next lap, but he never made it back a third time. He stopped and literally sat there for about five minutes. I texted him and requested he cancel the trip and explained that I would get a different driver. I never heard back from him. So I canceled it and called for the trip a fourth time at 11:23pm. This time the driver came right to the location in under a minute and everything worked like it was supposed to. The problem is I got 3 cancellation fees and had to stand outside in the cold rain for 30 minutes just to get a ride. Again there were drivers everywhere so it was very frustrating that it was such an ordeal to get a ride. while watching everyone else coming and going in there Uber rides. I expect Uber will reimburse me for the cancellation fees and I would appreciate a credit for the hassle and poor experience. If not, I will give Lyft a try and no longer use Uber. Please let me know what you can do for me.\"\n\nThe response I got:\n\"You were appropriately charges a cancellation fee\"\n\nThe obviously didn't even read my message and just sent me a blanket statement response. \n\nGoodbye Uber, hello Lyft."

The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab.

        "content": "Uber recently launched in islamabad, Pakistan and they have poor service over here. Uber drivers accept the request of customer and didn't come to pick them up and after waiting for long time customers usually cancels the ride and have to pay the penalty. Furthermore sometimes drivers also start the ride from their own location and cancels them and the customers gets charged this time too. \nThey don't take strict actions against drivers who do such things. Why we got charged? Why don't you put penalty on such drivers? Moreover uber doesn't have helpline where customer can call and tell about his problems. You can only message them and usually no reply comes from them.\nCareem is much better then uber.\nMuch disappointed by the behaviour of the drivers.\nKindly ask the team of uber, islamabad to penalty the drivers who do not come to pick customers and just accept the ride for the sake of money and they neither pick the call of the customer. \nPlease improve your system.\nTruly disappointed.\nPoor service."

The charge displayed on the app was different than the actual money charged. It was only a short trip of 2 miles and before midnight. I only requested the ride because it said less than $8. $19.27 was definitely not the fee I agreed to prior to my request. Utter deception! I am extremely disappointed. I reported it within 24 hours, as soon as I found out the next morning. They kept ping-ponging the issue from person to person and never got it resolved in a timely manner. They even said they were \"unable\" to find the trip I was referenceing. I was like REALLY? IT WAS JUST LAST NIGHT. I screenshot the trip + charges and sent it over and yet they kept claiming they could not find it. I would have not requested that ride if I knew they would charge me that much. At least the customer should have been informed about the fee differences (at least a range on how much the customer will be charged at the end of the trip) prior to making decision on whether to take the ride or not. ZERO INFORMATION. Total disaster. Complete fraud!"

Enter it right before you request a ride in the promotions tab. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing! The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

Someone was able to get me right away and was very professional, and then recently I wanted to get to school since I didn't have a family ride, and from 12 to 3 I had everyone cancel on me (5 uber drivers) luckily one was nice enough to tell me he couldn't make it but the others refused to take me. Someone down the street couldn't even take me to my destination that is literally like 10 miles away. I'm most likely never going to take uber again. It's so crappy"

I certainly don't want drivers know where I am going after a ride, nor do I want Uber to be capable of following my every step (and draining my battery to zero). \n\nSo goodbye. It was fun to give you a couple thousand $$$, but it's time to graduate to a firm that's respectable.  Happy to say I used Lyft for the first time today and it was basically the identical experience - but for less money and without the personal privacy abuse offered by Uber.\n\nOriginal Review: \nSince the app and service are tightly coupled, my review is for both. \n\nOverall, very good. Generally better than a cab. I have had one problem driver - crazy guy - but likely no less crazy than some cab drivers I have had. \n\nApp could be easier to use, but it is quite good."

I contacted Uber to get the erroneous rating removed and they said \"there is nothing we can do.\" Didn't even seem like they cared or made an effort."

Enter it right before you request a ride in the promotions tab. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing! The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

Usually if there are 3-5 cars visible on the map I'll get a pick-up accepted within 2 minutes but right now it's making me wait for 5 minutes or more!\n\nI understand the rating system is to protect the drivers from annoying customers or troublemakers but if I need to tip to keep my rating up with drivers then this defeats the purpose of Uber's no-tip policy."

Holidays include other dangerous people on the road that's a safety issue not only for you but the driver as well. Considering rush-hour you are keeping the driver from picking up other people and making more money so naturally you would get a price surge. Also I navigated the app you have to be a complete moron not to understand it. And as for the new update it only tracks are location if you're dumb enough not to close your background apps, if people take a moment and read things carefully or look at their options in settings you can tell that it only tractive your background Apps still open. As for theirpolitical stance I really don't care I'm here for a ride not a political debate. If you're gonna be that person who complains because of political stance or the inability to read the app properly and find out what the location tracking actually does in certain instances then I suggest getting an actual taxi that you can properly report for bad service.

The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

I live in an apartment complex and I pin it at the entrance and walks toward it until the driver comes. Now, it shows my building which is far away from the entrance and inaccurate for the driver who is now likely to call me to ask me stupid questions about my pick up location. \n\nSo essentially now I need to walk to the entrance and ask for a uber there and wait. How convenient! \n\nI mean it's so stupid. Did you guys have meetings and you thought this through? \n\nI am an app developer myself, I am so unimpressed by the work being done, without a doubt I could do a much better job. That's not corporate level work. More like something I did Friday night completely drunk.\n\nSeriously, I wanted to work for uber as an engineer but the upgrade is so bad that I am questioning leadership and how such a poorly designed and not user friendly app was ever approved. \n\nSpeed? I don't see any change, same 3 seconds to wait when I open the app. It actually seems like it lags a bit more as the map doesn't load automatically. \n\nRidiculous. Deleted."

The app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver. The customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

In other words, your current location (which can be your pickup location) is not always correct. Sometimes it shows me in a street next to where I actually am. \nSo, be sure to drop the pin in a correct place otherwise you will confuse the driver and he/she cannot find you. \nAgain, this is not an Uber issue, it's a general San Francisco GPS issue which is probably caused by signal interference or high buildings?\n\n---Update---\nI experienced the same location issue in New York too. \n\nGET A FREE RIDE:\n------------------\nIf you are new to Uber make sure to enter this promo code before your first ride: uberFreeRide747\n\nTo do that, from the app menu go to \"Payment\" and in in \"Add Promo/Gift Code\" enter the code \"uberFreeRide747\". Your ride will be free!\nBecause everything is better FREE!\n\nIf you find this review helpful, please mark it as helpful. ;)"

Might as well try it out since it won't cost you a thing!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

Might as well try it out since it won't cost you a thing!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

Lately they have been overcharging the rider and paying the driver as little as 50%. \n\nI've had trips where the driver payout is $14 but rider is charged $26. Ubers commission alone is $10. For another ride, the total fare was $106, Uber commission was $33. The reason why this happens is Uber grossly miscalculates the route, or outright OVERCHARGES the rider. They do this on X rides to subsidize their pool rides. Honestly it is such a shame, such sleazy tactics. If we use faster routes, Uber ends up keeping the difference, rather than crediting the passenger or paying the driver. According to this, it is in our best interest to take the LONGEST possible route. \n\nDo yourself a favor as a rider and calculate the mileage and time driven. Then look at your overall cost. The rates are listed publicly I'm each region. YOU WILL BE SHOCKED AT HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'RE TAKING. It's straight manipulative, deceptive and demeaning. This has to change and stop. \n\nOn top of that their support downright disgusting; they have a system where as soon as they respond to a question it is selected as RESOLVED. I've had completed Quests where I have not received my bonus, they listed as resolved and say wait 24-48 hours, after that they say wait till next pay statement, how is this issue resolved if I haven't received the funds nor is it reflected in the balance? It should instead say responded, or replied back to. \n\nUNBIASEDLY this is the WORST rideshare company. Everything I have said is OBJECTIVELY true."

I can honestly say even if you choose not to use the promo code I gave above you should definitely give Uber a try. For those who do use the coupon I greatly thank you.

The app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button!!! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again. The customer support is also fantastic!! I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

I found myself, however, over and over again giving Uber a pass every time they were in the news for sexual harassment by Uber's CEO to bullying tactics in their business dealings. After I was recently told that they contributed heavily to Donald Trump's campaign I'm out. For good. Many of their drivers are immigrants struggling to survive and make a better life for themselves. They have fought the odds to get to safety, to feel included in the American Dream and to provide a better life for their families than they could have otherwise. They have risked their personal safety and their lives to come to America and work for ...Uber, a company that, with its incredible wealth and ambition, is actively working against the betterment and well being of its own workers. What kind of a backwards, disgusting company mission is that? I'm done with Uber and it's cocky, greedy, POS CEO and buddies. I've deleted their nosy app and I will never use this service again."

I've contacted Uber regarding this but never received any response. And now you are asking to collect location info at background. There's no more option to allow reading location only when the app is running. You told that you need location info within 5 minutes after ride. No, there's no reason I want to share that, and there's no reason I trust you that you only collect what you promised. I have disabled location sharing on this app. Doesn't that make the app practically unusable? Yes. But not that I'm going to care because I'll never use this service again. I just keep this app installed so every time it is updated, I'll come and post a 1-star review. And I still remember that you reserved hundreds of Lyft cars then cancel them and repeat.

Since uber doesn't have a number you can call I get the same automated messages from their incompetent team that reassures me everyday that the issue is solved but it's not. Save yourself the trouble and issues and use Lyft. I've been charged for trips that I've never taken, had drivers that drive 15 mph over the speed limit, and there are ALWAYS GPS issues. Just a greedy company that cares nothing about their customers anymore since they've made it big. Good old America for you."

Might as well try it out since it won't cost you a thing!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

Might as well try it out since it won't cost you a thing!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

Just being totally honest. I've experienced sweet and loving drivers to extremely prejudiced racist drivers. But, I guess that's part of the 'trip', right? Some drivers aren't willing to even wait for the passenger to order food. Overall, I would like the standard of the drivers to be increased tremendously, and also-- a driver somehow hacked into my account and got $500+ and spent it in NEW YORK!! Unbelievable, if you don't expect me to get a refund your ridiculous."

Enter it right before you request a ride in the promotions tab. Might as well try it out since it likely won't cost you a thing! \n\nThe app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

So I called him. He sounded like he was sleeping and I woke him up. He asked me for my destination and I gave him my address over the phone. Waited another 10 minutes and he was still not moving from his original location. I called back twice and he let it go to voicemail. I cancelled and ordered another Uber. This driver called me as soon as I confirmed my pickup location. He asked me to give him my address through text. I told him I will not do that. He said he was real close and could pick me up. We disconnected and then he called back asking again for my address. I asked him what the deal was with asking for my address if it's already on the app, he couldn't give me one. He said your app does not provide the address. He hung up on me and also didn't show up. \n\nI live about 8 miles from the airport. It must not be worth it to your drivers to pick someone up and drop them off to a near location. I was stranded at the airport because I was counting solely on your app. That tells me I shouldn't trust your services if the reliability is so minuscule. \n\nIf I don't get a response from you I will not ever use your services again and will not encourage any of my friends or family to use your services either."

Go to the Payment tab in the app and enter the coupon under promotions. Might as well try it out since it won't cost you a thing!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

Another time the driver parked on the other side of the street in a parking lot and I had to cross but by the time I finally found the car and crossed the road the 2 minutes were up then charged me $5 then asked me to request him again. What's wrong with people??  UBER HAS TURNED INTO A SCAM!!! Lyft is 100% better and have the sweetest people who text then call you to meet up. They are actually committed to their jobs.

Uber says they only keep using your location for five minutes after a ride, but their app requests your location even outside of this timeframe. Look in Location Services privacy after not opening the app for a day-there's an arrow next to the app, indicating they've accessed your location. This dishonesty is completely unacceptable. I'm uninstalling Uber."

Go to the promotions tab on the app and enter the coupon there. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing!!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver's face, phone number, and car make and model. It's amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don't see why you would ever use a yellow cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it's still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn't have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I'm very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations and not on the app customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!"

Another instance the driver was a block away then it redirected to a suburb nearby and after 20 mins it finally let me cancel the trip and order a new ride. Also, the GPS randomly decides which route is best and whenever/wherever there's the most traffic that's the way it sends you, but when there isn't a lot of traffic it sends you the \"correct\" route that's faster and $5+ cheaper. Some drivers try to argue with me about taking the route I want to take- I'm not getting on the highway to travel southwest then northeast for 20+ mins when my route is direct and never ever more than 10 mins. \nAll in all- this app is becoming worse and worse with each update."

Seriously!! \n\nEnter it right before you request a ride in the promotions tab. Might as well try it out since it likely won't cost you a thing! \n\nThe app is easy to use and intuitive, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make/model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have car chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away, and price is usually the cheapest."

To combat that policy I turned off location tracking altogether and starting manually entering my address whenever using the app but it seems they didn't code the app well to respect privacy settings as Apple requires as the app will hang crash and generally misbehave when you run it this way (to the contrary, when this occurs I can turn location back on and everything works well again). Uber, there are a few things you can do to get back in my good graces 1) the option for \"while using app\" should be made available in privacy locations settings, \"never\" and \"always\" are not the only two options 2) collecting location data after a ride should only be done on an opt-in basis and 3) should I decide to use the \"never\" privacy option as Apple intended your app should work bug free. Until then I'm a reluctant user of your app (as the rest of the service is still MUCH better than taxis) but only one star for you given how difficult it is to use the app and still maintain my privacy.\n\nAlso, 273 mb???  Really?  What else are you doing that a relatively simple app requires 273 mb?"

Therefore I was forced either to end the ride or pay. I contacted customer service, and every time they explain what surge pricing is, and that I am the one who accepted it!!!

Now it won't let me schedule a ride because apparently I have an \"unpaid fare\" even though it charged me and my friend extra last time. What a sh***y app"

It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

Both problems were resolved promptly by customer service. The first issue was when a driver was taking way longer than expected to pick me and my friends up. I ended up cancelling and putting in a different request, but then I was still charged for the first one for some cancellation fee I think. Well, considering the whole reason I cancelled was because we had to wait much longer than anticipated, I didn't feel it was fair that I still had to pay. Customer service agreed and refunded the money back to my account (to be used for future use).\nThe second issue was with a reckless driver. The drive was less than 5 miles, but he swerved in and out of lanes on the highway and made abrupt stops. I sometimes get really bad motion sickness, and I somehow managed to hold in my puke during the ride. As soon as I got home, I threw up in my front yard. (Not my most lady-like moment...) When prompted to rate my ride, I complained about the driver. Within minutes, I was completely refunded!\nOverall, I don't have any major complaints, but I do commend the Uber customer service."

Both are excellent, less expensive alternatives to Uber, and without the personal privacy abuses offered by Uber.\n\nThanks Uber, for showing me that there are better fish in the sea. \n\nI'm pretty sure that Uber hopes that all the negative reviews are by robots working for the competition, and that Uber is working hard to hire an army to counter attack. Nope. There are just a lot of disappointed customers.  Fix your service and the reviews will improve.\n\nOriginal Review: \nSince the app and service are tightly coupled, my review is for both. \n\nOverall, very good. Generally better than a cab. I have had one problem driver - crazy guy - but likely no less crazy than some cab drivers I have had. \n\nApp could be easier to use, but it is quite good."

About 4 minutes later, the driver cancels and Uber tells me that the rate is now $24, due to it being peak driving time.\n\nIf it's not obvious, let me explain why that is completely unacceptable. You have me waiting, you cancel on me, and if that's not already rude, you now say that the rate is more than DOUBLE the original quote!\n\nIf that's not an example of poor customer treatment, I'm not sure what is. This is a fatal flaw in the system, and it serves only to benefit the driver and Uber. \n\nUber, you've lost my business permanently, but let me give you some advice on the way out: \n\nIf you plan on being in business 5 years from now, you will build a way to compensate your passengers via an *automatic* voucher system to adjust for price hikes when it's the DRIVER'S fault for cancelling. And no, having to call you and complain just for a \"we're sorry\" promo code is too much to ask for when we're talking about an app that is supposed to provide an instant-pay-instant-serve experience. Circumstances like this should be automatically corrected. It's possible with current technology and a little bit of willingness to provide a proper customer experience. Figure it out now or someone else will."

Why?.....\"Why should I?\" Then he proceeds to tell me to \"Go f*** myself\", floors it and leaves. \nThis was not on a public street, but in a very busy casino here in Las Vegas. It was very crowded and everyone heard him and gasped. \nAs I said, Uber doesn't see this issue as concerning and aren't too worried about what it says about their brand with this kind of behavior and the giant U mounted in the windshield. \nSeeing how low the bar is to continue being an Uber Partner, I'll be using Lyft in the future."

It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy!!! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready!!! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service!! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!!"

Go to the promotions tab on the app and enter the coupon there. Might as well try it out since it probably won't cost you a thing!!\n\nThe app is simple, easy to use and intuitive by design, giving you important info like the driver’s face, phone number, and car make and model. It’s amazing how quick and seamless the entire process is. A car comes to your door within minutes of pressing a button! The drivers are real people, they are very polite and their cars are clean! Some even come with complimentary water, gum and candy! Even if you want to charge your phone, a lot of drivers have phone chargers at your ready! UberX is definitely cheaper than your average cab. After all this, I don’t see why you would ever use a yellow cab again. Even if you want to get a black car on the occasional night out, it’s still cheaper and more convenient than hiring your own private driver.\n\nThe customer support is also fantastic. I got overcharged on one of my trips and I didn’t have to say anything more than a comment on my driver feedback to get a full refund. I’m very happy and I hope Uber continues to exceed my expectations in not only the app but customer service! I also prefer Uber much more than other competitors, mainly because they have so much more supply and cars are always just a few minutes away!!"

Both are excellent, less expensive alternatives to Uber, and without the personal privacy abuses offered by Uber.\n\nThanks Uber, for showing me that there are better fish in the sea. \n\nI'm pretty sure that Uber hopes that all the negative reviews are by robots working for the competition, and that Uber is working hard to hire an army to counter attack. Nope. There are just a lot of disappointed customers.  Fix your service and the reviews will improve.\n\nOriginal Review: \nSince the app and service are tightly coupled, my review is for both. \n\nOverall, very good. Generally better than a cab. I have had one problem driver - crazy guy - but likely no less crazy than some cab drivers I have had. \n\nApp could be easier to use, but it is quite good."
