        "content": "This is a pretty good app by Google. Currently there is a problem that I\\'m seeing with badge notifications not properly updating.  I\\'ve tried to remove the app from my phone and reinstall it but that didn\\'t solve the issue.  Started with iOS11 so I\\'m guessing it is related. I would like an option to mark something as read from the notification screen instead of, or in addition to archiving. Maybe I\\'m alone in this but I don\\'t really use the archive feature.  Anyway, 3 stars until the badges issue is resolved.  It lets you check your email so it does its job. Nothing flashy or special.  Like most of Google\\'s apps.  It\\'s functional which is good enough.\n\nDropping rating to 1 star and uninstalling in a week if Google, one of the biggest tech companies in the world, can\\'t fix a notification bug.  I mean come on. I\\'m guessing that at least 1 guys job at Google is to care about the app working. Even if it\\'s just 1 guy he could have already fixed this in a day.  Get it together.  We give you all our private information willingly and you can\\'t have a guy fix the red badge that a 13 year old kid that is learning to make apps for the first time can edit and change?"

We have h HUGE issue with people not realizing they’ve missed an important email because Gmail nests emails with the same subject.  If you get several responses to an announcement by users who “Reply All”, the main topic  gets buried under the comments.\n\nThen we get a rash of complaints by members claiming they never received the announcement. If I search for it, I can’t find it unless I remember the subject line verbatim.  You can’t change this nesting feature on the mobile platforms.  If this could be changed, Gmail would be much more useful to us."

I’ll read all of my emails, sort them, and close out Gmail, and it’ll still show the old number of unread emails for the next couple hours. It never clears out the notification bubble - it just updates the next time I get new emails.

Not the Gmail app. It won't highlight or underline or auto correct. I am using a different app for now.

        "content": "I normally love this app, but ever since the new iOS 11 update, new emails are very slow to load; I'll get a banner notice of a new email but when I open the app to read the entire email the new email isn't in there and I have to swipe to refresh several times before the email shows up. In addition, once I've read it, the number notification for unread emails is very slow to clear. That is, the number that shows up next to the app icon when you have a new email stays there even after I've already read all the emails and tried swiping or opening and closing the app to try to refresh. It'll clear eventually on its own but the timing is very unpredictable -- 20 minutes to almost all day"

There no fingerprint lock, no snooze option, and little customization. I would prefer to have all my email on one view as an option. \n\nOther apps like Spark, Inbox and even Outlook offer these features. \n\nThe reason I have to use this app is because of the incredibly slow load time for gmail messages into third-party apps. It’s not all the time, but it’s frequent enough to be annoying where content takes minutes to load. \n\nIt’s frustrating being between a rock and a hard place with an interface I’d prefer on another app that takes too long to load gmail messages. It works fine for gsuite and non-gmail accounts. I would love to use one app for all email and wouldn’t mind the Google app if it was a bit friendlier for mobile and didn’t require so much navigation."

They've continually hit the reset button on overwhelmingly 1 star reviews by \"updating\" the app, yet hardly any of the updates have addressed the complaints which are largely macro issues. As a whole, it's still bad, and the one star reviewers are simply giving up on having to resubmit their reviews after each update. And look at the 5 star reviews - largely substance-free generic praise. I doubt most of them. Don't believe the 3+ star average. \n\nThis app is a visual assault. It's hard to get past the nausea inducing aesthetics. Fewer emails to see at a glance, pointless avatars, ugh, the red! The check box was MUCH more intuitive than the initials/avatar circle that have replaced it. It's simply harder to read and process at a glance. \n\nWhy did you bury the reply button? Most often, what I want to reply to is at the top. I shouldn't have to scroll down to reply. In general things that were intuitive aren't. It's not my job to figure this stuff out. It's your job to design it so I don't have to. \n\nThis update is terrible all around. A mess. No amount of tweaks will save this update. Revert to the previous version. Really. It's that awful.

Only issue is with the new update, the badge app icon notifications don’t update very well. Seems like every time I clear my inbox I still have that little icon outside the app telling me I have a couple emails when I don’t. Please fix. Also it would be nice if the app didn’t keep telling me the app works best with fewer than 5 accounts. I’m well aware that’s true but I use all 5 accounts regularly and I don’t plan on getting rid of one so it would be nice to not have this notification every time I open the app.  Otherwise a great app. - Update it appears both issues are still happening in the update. Hopefully these will get fixed soon???? - update again, still no fix. My rating is now a zero until the app is fixed. Next step is to download a third party mail client."

The Gmail app specifically needs improvement in viewing previous replies, especially those that come in while you might be replying. I often miss replies because of the way responses are displayed. In the app it's very difficult to figure out who replied when during an active conversation that often includes more than two responders. I do like how social and promotion emails are separated, although I'd prefer to tweak those settings. There very well may be a control but it's not obvious if there is, nor have I gone looking."

Gmail is the best of the field because it is fast and the most reliable. \n\nThat said, it has a few things I’d love to see addressed to make it 5 stars:\n\n1) Freezing - the app occasionally hangs on the message list page, especially when going from landscape to portrait mode. Sometimes it recovers, other times you have to kill it. My guess is that it’s doing a remote call and the UI is waiting on it to finish when it shouldn’t be\n\n2) drilling into the to and from fields. Apple iOS makes this easy - you can click someone’s name to find their phone number from you contacts and call or text them. \n\n3) replying or forwarding specific threads in messages is cumbersome. Gmail buries this action in an ellipsis when it needs its own small icon. Apples iOS app does this well\n\n4) unified inbox, starred and sent messages for multiple accounts - all the other apps do this well\n\n5) message snoozing - outlook for iOS and mail (fka gladly do) do this well\n\n6) Dropbox integration for file attachments"

        "content": "I only give 4 stars, but could easily go to 5 with a small feature added. \n\nI've been using the Gmail app from the beginning after I got my first smart phone - first an android, now an iPhone. I have loved this app and it's multiple features that replicate using the desktop - making this app No#1 in my book for many years - until now. \n\nMany of the other email apps have added \"privacy\" step by adding the option of Touch ID to open. This feature is something that I would love to see Google incorporate into this app. \n\nI manage several gmail accounts-business and personal. Though my phone itself is password locked, there are times that a family member or friend has asked to use my phone to make a quick call or search for something, which means that my gmail is accessible (if they were so inclined to snoop). Touch ID would provide me extra security to my gmail (especially my business email account, which can contain sensitive information or documents) as well as give me some extra piece of mind when my phone is unlocked. \n\nIs adding this feature something that is forthcoming?  If not, then I feel that I need to find an alternative app for my gmail accounts. \n\nYou Touch ID isn't something you're concerned with, then this app is the way to go in managing your gmail."

Google, please work on your UX.  No doubt, this would be my main app if the font size match what I chose in iOS Settings.  Pleaaassseee!"

I angrily told them that If this is not fixed they have lost me as a customer Because their app is useless to me if i can’t see anything.\n   Now bear in mind, I wasn’t expecting anything to come from it. I figured, like most multimillion dollar companies, my complaint would be ignored along side many others. But, instead of being ignored I found that within two weeks they released an update that fully fixed the problem and only my problem. Within two weeks the developers made the app go from impossible to use to being easily the best email app out there. They have earned my respect and gratitude as a customer. \n    If you want a great email app that notifies you when, and only when, the most important emails come through, helps you archive, prioritize and organize your emails and provides an enviorment where you can ensure your biggest problems will be handled with care and efficiency than gmail is the app for you.\n(This is not sponsored in any way, I just had to express my gratitude for this recent update.

I\\'ve followed all help and forum posts I\\'ve found and they\\'re pretty useless.

HOWEVER, when I check my email and clear out the unread emails, the badge doesn’t go away. Not only is this SEVERELY annoying as I prefer to maintain a clean home screen, it causes me to check my email when unnecessary. This usually means using data and time that is clearly not needed as I don’t have unread emails. \n\nI do like the functionality of the app, but I will not continue to use an app that creates unnecessary thought and slows productivity. To me, that is unacceptable and not the point. I humbly ask that Google fix this error or I will be forced to delete the app and go back to using the Apple Mail app."

Only issue is with the new update, the badge app icon notifications don’t update very well. Seems like every time I clear my inbox I still have that little icon outside the app telling me I have a couple emails when I don’t. Please fix. Also it would be nice if the app didn’t keep telling me the app works best with fewer than 5 accounts. I’m well aware that’s true but I use all 5 accounts regularly and I don’t plan on getting rid of one so it would be nice to not have this notification every time I open the app.  Otherwise a great app. - Update it appears both issues are still happening in the update. Hopefully these will get fixed soon????"

Google’s Material UI looks out of place on iOS but that’s not the end of the world.\n\nWhat IS a big deal, though, is the complete lack of support for iPad’s split-screen and slideover features. This could be overlooked if these were new features in iOS, but they aren’t. \n\nAt all. \n\nOther Google apps, like Docs and Sheets, support these modes (though it was a long wait) and it’s really inexcusable that Gmail doesn’t. \n\nThe app also doesn’t have a watchOS version, which means that Gmail users have to resort to using Mail.app or a 3rd party mail app to use a Gmail account on watchOS. \n\nFinally, the swipe actions in message list views aren’t configurable like the ones in other mail clients. Swiping left or right on a message offers the exact same single action, rather than several. Yes, you can set that single action to be either delete or archive, but users can’t expose a menu of choices like they can in Spark or even Mail.app. \n\nThese missing features prevent Gmail from being a truly great productivity app for Apple users."

I found the email still there under \\\"All Mail\\\" but there was no way to undo the archive and put it back into my primary folder, at least no way that was immediately intuitive. So that was super frustrating. Also, there is no \\\"mark unread from here\\\" in an email conversation. So if I mark something as unread, the entire email chain gets marked as unread. This is ridiculous. I sometimes have conversations with clients that have 50 emails back and forth. I don\\'t want to have to go through them all again. Unfortunately, the built-in iPhone mail app does the same thing. But at least it has an undo function. I have gotten to where I rarely check email on my phone because there isn\\'t yet a good app to deal with it. It used to be simple and it used to work. Now with all the folders and functions, replacing basic functionality, it just makes it a pain. Companies always try to fix things that aren\\'t broken and just break them in the process. So this app is deleted. And I will go back to using the iPhone mail app to scan the previews and go to my Mac to actually reply."

Adding attachments is cumbersome now; it automatically imbeds them in your message and you have to individually select each to make it an actual attachment - and the app always freezes; I have to close it out and reopen it to get them attached properly. The option of \\\"mark as unread/read\\\" no longer exists (SINCERELY miss that). Also, if I open a new email from iPhone\\'s drop-down notifications (banner), I can read it in the gmail app fine - but the app keeps it as unread until I re-open the app from the home screen and view the email again. I don\\'t get it?! Those are my biggest complaints. I like just being able to swipe to delete, but that convenience isn\\'t worth the loss of the other features and the frustration."

        "content": "I use this app daily, and most of the features are easy to understand, and my overall experience has been positive. However, there are a few kinks that seem odd to me. Unlike other mail apps, in order to move an email to the trash one must long press on the screen and then select a check box and as the last step press the trash icon. There is also no option to select all emails. To me this is inefficient and overly complicated. Other apps I've used simply use a swipe left gesture. In the Gmail app, this gesture archives the mail, cluttering your data storage with unwanted rubbish indefinitely."

People's gmail pics, yes, but funky initials with other things? Give us the option to get rid of that. I don't like it in general, but it's beyond that, it's not as functional for business. Here's hoping they at least offer a gmail thru g suite. I tried this for 1 day and am moving on."

But now that I've downloaded it. now that I've seen what it does for me visually and how it organizes everything for me - I'm hooked. I can glance at my mail and decide what I want to look at what I don't want to look at on my phone and my eyes aren't as strained. I'm hooked great addition thank you For the Gmail app."

Also it would be nice if the app didn’t keep telling me the app works best with fewer than 5 accounts. I’m well aware that’s true but I use all 5 accounts regularly and I don’t plan on getting rid of one so it would be nice to not have this notification every time I open the app.  Otherwise a great app."

I guess you get what you pay for in this case.\n\nI also agree that it would be nice to customize the colors. I'm not sure why they picked red - blue seems to be a major theme in their other products, and red just reminds me of Target. Sorry google, they've had a claim to red for far too long."

Why the heck don't you have a simple way to do a select all??  This seems like it should be a standard feature.  I don't do a lot of complicated things with email but I do get a lot of them.  I'm a scanner,  I scan through the headings and many times I'm not interested in any of them so I want to get rid of them.  Right now I'm using Airmail.  It's not perfect but it gives me the key features I like.  In airmail all you have to do is select and hold on one of the emails.  At the top of the column in great big letters the \"SELECT ALL\" option will appear.  After you \"SELECT ALL\" you then tap on the 3 dots and then can, move, mark as read, trash and a few other options.  Simple.  Why can't Gmail have something similar??"

Otherwise amazing app! i recommend downloading if you have to manage more than one email! Very fast and convenient other that a couple of minor problems!"

They\\'ve continually hit the reset button on overwhelmingly 1 star reviews by \\\"updating\\\" the app, yet hardly any of the updates have addressed the complaints which are largely macro issues. As a whole, it\\'s still bad, and the one star reviewers are simply giving up on having to resubmit their reviews after each update. And look at the 5 star reviews - largely substance-free generic praise. I doubt most of them. Don\\'t believe the 3+ star average. \n\nThis app is a visual assault. It\\'s hard to get past the nausea inducing aesthetics. Fewer emails to see at a glance, pointless avatars, ugh, the red! The check box was MUCH more intuitive than the initials/avatar circle that have replaced it. It\\'s simply harder to read and process at a glance. \n\nWhy did you bury the reply button? Most often, what I want to reply to is at the top. I shouldn\\'t have to scroll down to reply. In general things that were intuitive aren\\'t. It\\'s not my job to figure this stuff out. It\\'s your job to design it so I don\\'t have to. \n\nThis update is terrible all around. A mess. No amount of tweaks will save this update. Revert to the previous version. Really. It\\'s that awful. And again, I don\\'t believe the majority of the 5 star reviews."

It works great except you need to make preferences on a computer. This app doesn\\'t even allow you to group your emails into sub categories only conversations. I had given up on this program the first time I downloaded it because of how much of a pain it was. I was just prompted by my gmail to download this app for reasons that sounded good. Unfortunately when I went to the play store it showed that this app was already downloaded. If I left because I was disappointed and your updates all say the same things and don\\'t address the problems, why would I  waste my time and put it back on my phone??? My gmail that is through my phones settings for gmail is excellent. I have all the options I need!!! Why doesn\\'t google partner with apple to get some pointers on how a good email program should behave and what it should offer!!! Terrible app!!! Don\\'t waste your time!!!"

So, I\\'m curious: are there different reasons for each update, and you guys are too lazy to specify them for us?

Or are all of these updates merely to collect the personal information you wish to sell to your \\\"partners\\\"?

I move them, they CONTINUE to show up in the Promotions inbox. I\\'ve stopped trying to fight it. I surrender. \n\nFurther, it\\'s a PIG - takes up a ridiculous amount of space on my iPhone. \n\nThere should be something in the settings (of the app) where unsolicited emails/spam IMAGES can be set to NOT download on my phone. Seriously - if I \\\"report it as spam,\\\" (1) ~WHY~ am I still even seeing it on my phone, (2) if I\\'ve reported it as spam, ~WHY~ do I want the RISK of the images on my phone?\n\nI\\'ve been online since 1996. This is possibly one of THE most counter-intuitive apps I\\'ve ever used. \n\nThat\\'s enough for now. Go ahead - ask me to rate your dumb app again. I dare ya. 😈"

But this past year...maybe even longer...i feel like gmail has really gone out of its way to over complicate something that should stay simple and user friendly. Call me old fashioned and maybe even dumb... but what was so wrong with having just one simple mailbox associated with your ONE email address? My mailbox is just entirely too confusing now. It sorts your mail into 4 different unnecessary (for us common folk)folders... I could understand if you\\'re getting hundreds of emails a day but when you\\'re just receiving emails from work, family and friends and perhaps emails regarding subscriptions, online receipts and etc I don\\'t really see the need for a \\\"primary\\\", \\\"social\\\", \\\"promotions\\\", and \\\"updates\\\" folder. Half the time I miss important emails because i just figure they will all show up in my \\\"primary\\\" mailbox that is defaulted as the main folder that pops up when I login  and not think to look for them in the \\\"updates\\\" or \\\"promotions\\\" folder, for instance. I ABSOLUTELY HARE gmail so new format and layout and their whole concept now! If my gmail address wasn\\'t over 7 years old and linked to basically my whole life, I\\'d delete and switch to yahoo in a heartbeat! 👎👎👎 from me!"

I would much prefer that each email message be separate. \n\nIf I try to toss an unnecessary part of a message string, I end up tossing every connected message in the string. \n\nAlso, when I try to reply, it is difficult to know where I should type.

It's enough to make me use the account to my IOS mailbox. I can't find ANY instructions, directions, or what have you for the Gmail app, and I've looked online. \n\nAnd it's a memory hog, too. \n\nGet a grip, Google. Fix your junk."

I made that mistake last night. \n\nI used to enjoy this app now i'm in a constant state of annoyance whenever I click on a link in my emails, in opens in an in-app browser. When i change the settings to open in Safari, it still opens in the in-app browser and then i have to hit the safari icon on the bottom. This extra step is so unnecessary and oddly time consuming becasue I can't send multiple emails to safari to view later while cleaning out my inbox. This new method FORCES me to view in the in-app browser one email at a time. \n\nPlease fix this!!! The app was great the way it functioned before now i hate it, and have to look elsewhere for a new email app. Never update, lesson learned!!!!"

It doesn't motivate me to check email with a huge number, but if each day it reset, I'd know I have new mail.\nI hope Google reads these reviews!"

If one of them comes from a no reply return address it's extremely difficult to continue the \"conversation\". It also shows only the HTML code, not HTML so it's very difficult to read. It will not allow a copy and paste so you could change the reply address to the correct one. There should be a setting to either separate the individual emails or to not use the threaded conversations. I just wasted 2 hours just to reply to an email with an order number. Why can't they leave my emails alone so I can reply as I want and not have to figure out a threaded email with no html? I DON'T WANT them to put all emails on a subject into one. It doesn't work for me. It's enough to make me just give up Gmail and use some other email service. The other Gmail app says it also uses \"threaded conversations\". I know which emails refer to each other, I don't need you deciding for me, messing my emails up and making them nearly impossible to read in the process."

It is awful. It\\'s crazy to me that Google won\\'t listen to thousands of complaints regarding this. In my job I will use the same subject line in many different conversations. So then it groups all of those emails together.  And many times important messages get lost in these lengthy \\\"conversations\\\".  \n\n2- It won\\'t allow you to add your signature right after your message.  It adds it at the very bottom of the string of conversations making it pointless to have a signature at all.  Someone would have to scroll down to the bottom of the whole conversation to see your signature.  Who would do that??  How does google not see this as a problem?  Do they mean to put the signature at the very bottom or is this a glitch?\n\nGoogle stop wasting time on STUPID updates like this last one and actually step up to the plate and fix the real problems."

I sent three test emails and haven't received any of them yet. I love the idea for the app, however it needs a few tweaks to be ready and usable for hard-core users. So far the iOS native email client works much better, is much more functional, and has a few more needed options. I'll wait for the update before I really start to use it. More of the regular GMail functionality would make this a better app."

Until 8/1/17, gmail was rock solid òn my ipad 4 and never crashed.  Now (8/15/17) gmail crashes all the time, especially when I do things like writing and sending an email or switching between my folders.  I go from writing an email to watching the app close to then if i double tap my ipad to see a list of running apps to i can sometimes see it is still in the background.  If it is still running it has lost some of my information, ortherwise  the app crashes hard and the app is no longer running.  Google, Please roll back one release to a more stable version that existed prior to 1 August 17."

I don't want to select 'Empty Trash Now' to delete all my trashed emails. What if I only wish to delete one or a couple emails and keep the rest?  \n\nIt's obvious that Google intends for this app to become more like their Inbox app so that they can eventually merge it with Inbox or get rid of the Gmail app altogether. \nFor me, going back to Apple Mail!\n\nEdit - after innumerable updates, the following issues still remain: emails still cannot be deleted from the Trash folder.  Why I cannot have control of deleting my own emails from the Trash folder is beyond me!  Second issue: it would appear the Fit To Modify feature is now forever gone as some of my emails cannot even be read as the text/font is too small. \nReally nothing to note or see here — returning to Apple Mail which seems to be suiting my emailing needs just fine, plus added bonus, my emails aren't scanned and read by Apple (privacy is respected there)!\n\nEdit – so after the newest update (08/10/17), one still cannot delete individual emails in their trash folder.  Why?  It's my email, but apparently Google doesn't seem to think so, and instead controls MY email.  \nI also see that another issue hasn't been fixed - some emails not fitted for the iOS screen. \nObviously nothing of worth to see here therefore returning to Apple/iCloud Mail which has been meeting my email needs more than adequately since switching over."

Everything I want to attach is in iCloud, I don't use Google Drive. It's really annoying to have to go through the iCloud or Pages app to write Gmail account emails with attachments (and you cant reply in an email chain with an attachment located in iCloud--you can only start a new chain). Only Google seems to have this aversion to letting users access iCloud, which in my case is integrated with my computer's hard drive and so contains everything."

When I send a file, I want to send the file, not help advertise GDocs with some crap link to a service that should be shut off, like Google+. We see it. We know. Stop it. No one wants it. Sending a link instead of the file is not what anyone needs. I've now moved my files to a place that both Apple Mail Gmail can access, and will stop using GDocs. I want to edit my resume and send it, not hype a less than useful service from google.\nFurthermore, they dropped access to the Apple drive to force you to use their own Gdrive. This makes it less that useful, and forces me to use their web app to email my files, until I move off of this service altogether. Can't wait to stop using Gmail. Just a waste of my time. This makes Yahoo Mail look like a better option for my secondary mail service. And don't get me started on the garbage they force feed you on Android devices. Garbage in the cloud raining down into a device that never receives an OS update... what are they trying to pull here?! Avoid this service and Android. It's not worth the hype."

        "content": "The latest update has left me feeling frustrated.\n\nI find I am not getting notifications consistently, accounts listed as important have either lost their important flag or the app has failed to identify them as such and I am not getting notified in a timely manner. \n\nThere is also the annoying problem of being notified of messages which have already been read. Leaving you to think you have received a new message when you haven\\'t . The benefit of Gmail was that it was much quicker than the Mail client app on my iPad, now...it is a wash...  I hope these issues are resolved soon.\n\nIt\\'s now 2017...\nAnd it\\'s come full circle. Back to not getting notifications after the newest update... message threads are often out of order. \n\nIt would be very helpful if when an update is released instead of stating \\\"bug fixes\\\" , developers would state the bugs they have addressed in the rev being released.  Dropping my rating. The app causes more problems for me than it solves. Apple mail more reliable at this point."

While it is understood that the web UI has all the capabilities, the ipad app has the core to make it useful. \n\nMy only reason for 4 stars is that the app tends to crash if you delete too many emails too quickly, or try to do an attachment, or try to open the Google Calendar app from within Google Mail. (Hopefully there is an auto crash reporting in background to improve this for the future).\n\nMissing features I would love to see, would include the ability to swipe on a message a different direction to \\\"move\\\" it to a folder or apply a \\\"label\\\".  And the ability to access other cloud drives for attachments, although I will not hold my breath on this one, since Google likes to keep resources in the family.  And maye not a feature, but I wish the same feature set was availalble on the iphone to make using the two devices a similar experience.\n\nOutside of that, the new Google Mail app is now my \\\"go to\\\" app for email."

Gmail is superior to the native Apple mail app in SO many ways, mainly the auto-sorted inbox folders. The native iPhone mail app just throws all the good and junk mail into one big bin and it's a time consuming mess to slog through - BUT if I want to quickly create an event from an email, I have to go find the message in the Apple app and create an event that way. On the Gmail desktop, I can create events. A mail app should be a productivity tool, not a barrier."

The craziest part about it was that this was their mode or method of helping me to recover access to my account. LOL! What a joke! I\\'m surprised at how pathetic this app is! It might be because I have about 30,000 emails stored in there. I heard that they don\\'t like that at all. Well if that\\'s the case then why do they allow it? How backwards that?"

Still useless to me. So here is my review from eight months ago: The update from early November is hideous and counter intuitive. After less than ten minutes with it I\\'ve deleted the app and gone back to Apple\\'s built in Mail app. A fifth of the screen space of every line previewing the mail is taken up with a giant circle letting me know the first letter of the name of who has emailed me? What function does this serve then to distract my eyes and deter me from immediately interpreting the message I received. Absolutely useless and ugly. Goodbye Gmail app."

Unfortunately, now, I really hate this app. I haven't tried yet, but I am going to see if I can get my old version back.  I loved the fact that I could select several unopened emails at a time and either move them to the correct folder or delete them all at once. I loved the ease of moving my emails into my folders. I loved the intuitive ability gmail had to guess which folder I wanted to move my email into. Now, when I tap the file folder in the app, my email DISAPPEARS. It goes into an archive somewhere, but I can't find THAT folder on my phone. Is there a visible \"archive\" folder? Additionally, when I want to ensure my email goes into the correct folder, I have to complete a multi-step process: hit the \"...\" hit the \"more\" find and hit the \"move\". I'm thinking those were the steps, it's so complicated now I can't even remember. Essentially, you did make the app cleaner and more contemporary, but it's not convenient at all. Just my two cents. PS I am probably going to send this rant every time I try to use the stupid app to organize my email from my phone... until I find that old version and reinstall it! lol"

Second, why haven't you implemented a feature to customize actions on an email based on which way I swipe?  For example, swipe right=mark as read or un-read toggle.  Swipe left=delete.  Microsoft's Outlook OWA has this.  Saves a ton of time. \n\nWhen this app came out I stayed with the original gmail app for quite some time because it had a lot more functionality (like printing and connecting with other apps).  Now you've started removing features.  I'm now removing this app until you put back the essential features.  The interface is nice and all, but seriously on the glaring lack of base functionality?"

Later on that same day I get a notification from via gmail that charges are being done through my bank. Someone hacked into my bank acct and wiped me clean out . But thanks to Gmail I was alerted and called my bank and cancelled my debit card. Saved me an headache not knowing and possibly looking dumb at the checkout line not knowing why my card is getting rejected. So i love this app....."

Back to tedious copy-paste-call. \n\nThe reply suggestions are interesting though. Saves about 10 seconds but I'm not sure how I feel knowing that google is parsing and understanding all of my email content. \n\nUpdate. All of a sudden, I can now edit text in forwarded messages...I had not updated the app, this functionality just appeared on its own...just like in google's map app the nearby traffic widget just stopped working on its own one day. Curious. \n\nSignatures still are not tying into my web gmail settings and are completely unusable for aliases and HTML formatted signatures...which I need for my business use. At least give this functionality to your paying customers!\n\nAlso realizing how much I miss the reply & forward buttons at the top of the screen in gmail 4.x. \n\nMany improvements in gmail 5.x but they do not make up for lost features. \n\nOriginal review:\n\nBEWARE. gmail 5.x is simply rebranded inbox and lacks the same critical features, namely:\n\n-horrendous signature handling. No HTML signatures. No alias specific signatures.\n\n(fixed)-message forwarding limitations. Cannot edit forwarded message. \n\nThere's a longer list of reasons I hadn't switched from gmail 4.x to inbox but those are more preferences as opposed to critical requirements to do my work. \n\nThe 5.x search improvement is nice but irrelevant since I can no longer use the gmail app for work so I'm now searching for a new mail app for the first time since a native gmail app was introduced.\n\nDisappointed."

I have a an iPad Air with up-to-date software and the gmail is updated as well. I'm just waiting till I leave my current job in six months to ditch this worthless email app and address. Other email is much less privacy invasive, and have apps that are much better as well."

Now when I scroll it only shows for 2-3 months! I admit to being quite technology challenged, so is this somehow an oversight on my part?? Btw, isn't there supposed to be an Archive?? Where is it??\n\nMy only complaint other than the previous one above is, I've Accidentally deleted emails at least twice now by sliding the email to the side!! WTH?? The first time it happened, I wasn't quite sure wth happened! When it happened again a couple of weeks ? later, I saw how that works. Unlike when you Intentionally delete an email, there is no option to undo. I've noticed also that Gmail has become extremely touch sensitive. I've lost an email more than once by scrolling too far or whatever. The same thing happens in the Google search app. (which I use more by far than any other app in my iPhone) The Google apps, particularly Gmail seem to be getting less user friendly imo.\n\nJuly 4th ~ I'm really getting sick of Accidentally losing emails while scrolling!! It has happened at least 6-7 times now! It's ridiculous how easily unread (or Any) emails are archived with no chance to undo! Each time this has happened, I've No idea which email I've inadvertently archived!! (It happens so Fast and unexpectedly!) How pray tell can you check archived emails?? I see no way to do this! If you won't change your too touch sensitive archiving system, please at least give us a chance to undo an archiving."

        "content": "Update 6/29/17: WHY in the actual F*** does gmail continue to insist on using the browser preview? I want to open links directly into safari. Reduced to two stars until this is fixed. It's useless.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the browser preview cannot be disabled. Every time I click on a link it goes to gmails browser instead of safari. It's limited in its capability and annoying if I'm already logged into a particular website in safari. Gmail also glitches out sometimes if you click on an email notification banner, it will not open the email and has to be force closed or go back to the primary inbox. Other than that, I love that promotional and social email is separate from my primary email, the system works very well and i wish it was done on more email clients, like spark."

Are use my mobile app more than the desktop app and I do wish all the functionality and the desktop was on the mobile app such as  being able to make a message important on the mobile app. \n\nAlso the contact synchronization I think could be improved because sometimes it seems that either Facebook or Google wiped out my information while consolidating it. I'm not sure exactly what happens.\n\nI like the labeling in Gmail and I used to keep many important documents there and search I also backed them up but now that Gmail makes you pay for more data I cannot keep as much information for me the searching is an important component of my email environment. I've been able to figure out the searching pretty much with the use of the labels. \n\nI've given up trying to have an empty inbox now I just distinguish between important and everything I try to unsubscribe but it's just too much like an ocean that can't be stopped so right now Gmail is the best email application I found I came from a corporate environment which we use Outlook and I went from outlook to Gmail and I pretty much stay there.\n\nI do know that Big Brother is watching and everything I do is categorized according to data and marketing preferences and I don't like that.\n\nI am trying to make the move from Google to other encrypted and safe browsers but I haven't done it yet because the Google search engine is so good."

I don\\'t want to select \\'Empty Trash Now\\' to delete all my trashed emails. What if I only wish to delete one or a couple emails and keep the rest?  \n\nIt\\'s obvious that Google intends for this app to become more like their Inbox app so that they can eventually merge it with Inbox or get rid of the Gmail app altogether. \nFor me, going back to Apple Mail!\n\nEdit - after innumerable updates, the following issues still remain: emails still cannot be deleted from the Trash folder.  Why I cannot have control of deleting my own emails from the Trash folder is beyond me!  Second issue: it would appear the Fit To Modify feature is now forever gone as some of my emails cannot even be read as the text/font is too small. \nReally nothing to note or see here — returning to Apple Mail which seems to be suiting my emailing needs just fine, plus added bonus, my emails aren\\'t scanned and read by Apple (privacy is respected there)!"

Still CAN\\'T PRINT!!!  Mail I got prior to update suddenly put in Spam folder, who the H knows why.  So wish I could give a minus rating.  Will hang in awhile longer then, as much as I hate to have to change to another E-Mail will have no choice as this now is basically\nunusable!!!!\n\n11/24/16 - Just found can no longer print any of my E-Mails or change profile picture.

You have taken a decent, useful application and made it TOTALLY USELESS!!!!\n\n11/17/16 - Just installed most recent update, still as HORRIBLE as previous. \n\nIf could give a zero I would.  If mail has pictures these don\\'t forward, can\\'t edit Drafts, can\\'t get read mail to close after finished and  on and on and on.  To put it simply, HATE IT!!!! Please go back to previous version that actually worked and was much more user friendly.  UPDATE:  When try to edit a draft the whole app locks up.

I also used to have the ability to save PDF format directly into my iBooks, but for some reason this too they took away. What a hassle! Now I have to send my PDF to Notes and then import it to iBooks. Giving a giant company like Google feedback is nearly impossible, and when you do provide feedback, if they actually see it, then they want you to justify just why you want something. Really? Google you are too big for your britches! LISTEN to your customers!"

Up until this update I have preferred using the gmail app, however with the new \"improvements\" apple's included mail app is looking a lot more appealing.\n  \nUpdate: just when it seemed like they couldn't duck it up anymore, they found a way. They added annoying little reply option buttons, which at least you can turn off and this horrible blown up summary of a piece of email before you get to the actual email for things with calendar info or tracking that doesn't seem disable-able.  Google, haven't you ever heard the expression \"if it's not broken, don't fix it\"?!?"

It needs to be accessible at the top of a long email so you don't have to scroll through the whole thing. It also needs to allow you to reply to the original sender after you forward the message. Also you should pop up the keyboard and put the cursor at the start of the draft. That kind of thing is the basics you obliterated with that crap update. Now fix it."

So, they added the feature and now they\\'re ignoring it.  Pathetic.  Also, there is no way to disable pictures from displaying in email, which means more bandwidth use and higher exploit risk from pic decoders. Conclusion for gmail alternatives:  Alto for typical email users and Newton Mail for business class users.  gMail, I want to come back, but I suppose you have to weigh lost users like me against the privacy clueless suckers who will use gMail anyway."

This issue just occurred. Please fix. Wastes a lot of time!!\n\nI agree with other reviewers this update has a lot of flaws. For me the biggest being I can not swipe between emails to read them. I have to go back to the inbox to select next message. This slows me down immensely. Also easy of use has declined. The swipe to archive/delete shouldn\\'t be and/or it should be both (one direction archive one delete). Also I found the ability to select my emails but still not as functional as before, esp because less emails on screen and when I select too many it resets! The color is not great but I could overlook poor visual design if the function was there. The only feature I like on the update is the undo feature.

And now if you swipe to either the right or left it archives the emails and maybe I'm an idiot, but I can not figure out how to get to my archived emails to get rid ones I added on accident. If I'm dumb and just not seeing it, I can accept that, but then you have to remember that this is supposed to be an app even an idiot can use. So you know keep that in mind Google. Over all not happy with the changes to the newest version, I wish I had never updated it. I have a stop feeling I won't be using my gmail on my phone any more.

The colors make me feel like I've wondered into the kiddie section of a tacky carnival.\n\nUpdate: many months later, and you can't even print from the overhauled app. Seriously, why did Google ruin what used to be a highly functional app?"

Why can\\'t I separate those emails as I do on the website?\n\nIt won\\'t communicate spam or security warnings, which led me to open a phishing attachment via my phone. I\\'m embarrassed to admit I was fooled, but angry to see later that the web version of the same email showed a big red warning flag advising me of the danger. No such warning on this app. \n\nI\\'ve also noticed emails don\\'t arrive in real-time on the app. An email might show up on the web version but not the app. \n\nIn short: I\\'m keeping my gmail account but using this app only to see \\\"what\\'s going on\\\", waiting until I\\'m in front of the web version to actually accomplish things."

The iOS mail app that comes on an iOS device has an option to hide previews on the iOS lock screen.

I then use apple mail and it's there or I can go into my gmail sent folder and see the new email as part of the conversation but it doesn't show up in primary (it did temporarily and I did not move it).

It\\'s a basic feature of most if not all email apps, except for Gmail that is. This major feature is missing from Gmail and it means I have to remember to do this when I\\'m at my computer. For a premiere email service to not have such a basic feature is inexcusable. I don\\'t want to import my Gmail with Apple mail so I\\'m stuck with this until Google gets smart and decides to fix this. \n\nAnother basic feature missing is an unread mail category. So I can\\'t even group them together to go through unread emails. Again there\\'s no excuse for not having this feature. \n\nPlease add these basic email functions Google.\n\nFinally, not having the option to turn off conversations view is just impractical. This is not a great way to organize conversations and I hate it but if you use this app you\\'re stuck and have no choice but to live with it. \n\nI use this for my business so I deliberately keep it for separate use from Apple mail but that may no longer be possible. \n\nAnd don\\'t get me started in Google \\\"help.\\\" It\\'s anything but helpful. I like emails and phone numbers. It\\'s fine for people who have the time to hunt for their own answers but for the rest of us who have a life, I want to quickly and easily be able to find contact info to get in touch with a human being. Google is better at this than most but it\\'s still hard to locate."

I now realize Sting's song \"I'll be watching you\" actually predicted google. Their EULA might be lifted from this song.\n\nAnd your very analyzed email gives you ads based on your personal communications. (Don't we all love merchants listening in to our daily thoughts to friends and family so they can try to sell us stuff?) But they do deliver your email, so 2 stars... I think other email apps can do that too (and some try to let you be private). No need to steal privacy when we willingly surrender/sell it for a popular email app."

Allow us to select which direction the swipes go/mean. So left for delete, right for mark as unread/read \n2. 3D Touch for emails \n3. Things like tracking numbers, travel etc just show the details in the app and not have is copy/paste the tracking code to UPS/FedEx etc \n4. Same idea with travel plans similar to inbox. \n5. Snooze/mute notifications. I get every Friday about 500 notifications from our server and it blows up Notification Center. If I can snooze those that would be great. \n\nOverall it's awesome, keep it up!"

The way this is set up, private messages between two members of a group thread are visible in the truncated message history of future group messages. Non-mobile version doesn't have this problem and I can go to that email's 'Reply' button and voila... but not on any version of the new mobile app. \n\nget. your. act. together. \n\nAlso, why on earth can't I delete a message with a left swipe. Why are they both archive? Is that necessary..?"

Yes, but...  hmmm... no, It\\'s just creepy. I now realize Sting\\'s song \\\"I\\'ll be watching you\\\" actually predicted google. Their EULA might be lifted from this song.\n\nAnd your very analyzed email gives you ads based on your personal communications. (Don\\'t we all love merchants listening in to our daily thoughts to friends and family so they can try to sell us stuff?) But they do deliver your email, so 2 stars... I think other email apps can do that too (and some try to let you be private). No need to steal privacy when we willingly surrender/sell it for a popular email app."

Less functional.\n* Every time you update you get nagged to download chrome... Even after you've told it to stop nagging you.\n\nUnfortunately google is under the delusion that they know best. Sadly they rarely pull it off the way Apple can, across all of their different projects. \n\nAnyone know a good alternative to this app?"
