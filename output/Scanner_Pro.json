Its quick to scan and edit and although it has its quirks it is amazing for a scanner that just uses your phone camera. Every document that comes into my life goes into this scanner and latee saved on my computer so I can keep all my paperwork organized digitally. \n\nThe only necessary improvement for this app would be in the manner it helps you store and organize your documents. It is currently a frustrating system and i wish I could keep all docs organized in the app and not have to transfer to my desktop. It needs a better filing and referencing interface. Still gave it 5 stars to keep the app alive but if it doesnt improve I will drop a star because 4 is more accurate, so app developers please work hard on that interface for the next update! \n\nBTW this is my 1st EVER app store review because I am too busy to write them. That should show everyone how dedicated I am to this product. I need it in my life and would love for to work out its quirks. Thanks devs and thanks customers for reading my review; I hope it helps."

However, I bought this while frantically searching for a better Fax option than iFax (took too long) and I was really frustrated.  First, I couldn't figure out how to import/fax docs that were already in my Google Drive account, DropBox, Adobe/Adobe Cloud, etc..  I ended up having to re-scan all my originals, which was time-consuming & angering bc I was always pressed for time.  Maybe there's no way to do this?  The only \"import\" function I found was with pics in iCloud/on my iPad.  I wanted a PDF.  Then, there was no transmission receipt. Aaarrgh!!  A dialogue box told me it was successful but that's not quite the same, plus it disappeared in seconds.  No receipt for the fax purchase either.  No way to track my fax.  Where did it go??  To a server?  Directly to the recipient?  Was it secure?  I have many questions.  Not very pleased about that.  Boo on the online mag (Gizmodo) that recommended this as the best FAX app available.  Grrr."

        "content": "I have owned this app for years and generally switched between it and Scanbot to get the best scans. I just used it again for the first time in a few months today to scan a multi-page document and I am blown away. Under fairly poor lighting conditions (at nighttime under a yellow lamp) Scanner Pro gave me a perfect OCR scan of my document. Both pages were perfectly aligned, the edges of the pages were perfectly clean, the angle looked perfect, the crease in the paper was gone, and the pages looked perfectly white even though I took the scan under yellow tinted lighting. I tested the scan’s OCR by searching a few random words (in PDF Expert) and it worked perfectly. Wow - I don’t know what secret sauce Readdle has been infusing into this app lately but it’s miles ahead of where it used to be, even though it’s always been one of the top quality scanning apps in the App Store. Bravo, Readdle! Keep it up! PDF Expert and Documents have been invaluable apps to me; I hope Readdle keeps pushing forward."

Now, mind you, this is on a consumer level, not commercial level. I am not scanning 200 page documents, but easily scan 10-20+ pages in the amount of time it takes to flip to the next page. And the auto shoot feature is so handy! You just hold your phone over the document and it automatically takes a picture when it finds the edges of the document.

Even though my work doesn't require me to use PDFs, it's good to have. I purchased Turbo Scan cause I read it was better than Scanner Pro, yet I find myself switching back to Scanner Pro when I need copies of documents. I like the user interface better and the capture of the image. Scanner Pro does everything I need and everything you will want as well.\n\nUpdate Sept 22 2017\n\nI still love this app, it has gotten better over the years, no regrets, if you are reading this download it. I will help you either now or later in life."

It scans in color, black and white, photos, text.   I save it or email it.  I can add it to my photos, the cloud,  or print.  It has saved me over and over! \n\nThe single only drawback for me was when I got a new phone I forgot and lost all my documents.  I was crushed.  I'm sure there is a way to sync so that doesn't happen again-I just forgot to do it!  I highly recommend it!!"

I think I paid $5 anyway. This app turns your phone into a reliable document \"scanner\" for less than a scanner wand, flat bed scanner or any other hardware solution for a portable scanner. It's very simple math and paying for the app keeps ads out your face and supports the great work this company is doing.\n\nThe quality does not correspond to the camera quality of your phone but, for documents that are clean and well lit with type or hand written text, you get good readable digital reproductions. You really can't beat the ability to save documents with the same device you carry around with you normally. It frees up clutter while giving you piece of mind that you can send official documents to people via email, on your phone or uploaded files to the cloud."

I would greatly appreciate if the app would no longer interrupt my work to solicit my review (which again, I have already given). \n\nScannable is super easy and fast, but isn't good at creating uniform documents (sizes were an issue for me). Scanbot is decent, but has workflow and detection issues. Scanner Pro gets is right most often, is most consistent with quality, and is generally the best app for organization. My only complaints are: 1. Rating nag screen doesn't go away even after rating (while rare enough, this is bad, and also persistent throughout Readdle apps) 2. The custom share sheet — most of the time, I just want to message or Air Drop my document. The trade off for this custom sheet is the option for a custom workflow, and is really nice."

It can integrate with both Evernote and OneNote anyway, and it reliably finds borders and scans much more quickly. It has lately been bug free and easy to use; however, you can also set up more complicated saving patterns. For instance, you can tell it to automatically save to such and such Dropbox folder without having to root around to find the right folder."

The app does a great job with OCR and the image quality with automatic line straightening truly makes this better than any other scanner (I've tried many). \n\nHowever; I just used this app to scan a few thousand pages in separate documents and folders and I regret it all. The app crashes after scanning for a while, which is fine except I only noticed much later that the app would combine random documents from different folders, remove names, and straight up delete existing documents when it crashes! I have already recycled the pages that got messed up so this is a permanent problem now. I have deleted and reinstalled the app multiple times with the same result. \n\nThe app is great - so long as you export anything important immediately so it doesn't get mangled by the app later.\n\nUPDATE - 1 Month later I'm getting even more issues just trying to get my data out of the app. I can either upload directly to a cloud service (takes about 1min/MB ish), attempt to download through iTunes (causes app on iPhone to crash before anything actaully loads in the file sharing list). \n\nI really, really regret using this app to scan so many important things."

Has manual or auto scan (on auto just hold phone over page ... app finds edges and captures page in seconds). Full color perfectly clear images. Also has choices to select pages from large scans (such as separating my 37 pp scan into 3 e-mails due to e-mail file size restrictions). Faster and easier than my PC scanner or office multi machine, and it's always in my pocket.  The more I use it the more I love it."

I've emailed the developer multiple times about this. I'd pay a subscription fee just to never have to deal with this on Readdle's apps. Alas, this hostile design element remains in ALL of Readdle's apps, and I don't know what more I can do about it. I know it's dumb, but 1-star reviews from now on. You've got my money (for iOS and Mac), and I'll happily pay for future updates, but that's it as far as Readdle and me are concerned. \n\nTO THE DEVELOPER: Readdle, I love your app, and have rated and reviewed it accordingly. I would greatly appreciate if the app would no longer interrupt my work to solicit my review (which again, I have already given). \n\nScannable is super easy and fast, but isn't good at creating uniform documents (sizes were an issue for me). Scanbot is decent, but has workflow and detection issues. Scanner Pro gets is right most often, is most consistent with quality, and is generally the best app for organization. My only complaints are: 1. Rating nag screen doesn't go away even after rating (while rare enough, this is bad, and also persistent throughout Readdle apps) 2. The custom share sheet — most of the time, I just want to message or Air Drop my document. The trade off for this custom sheet is the option for a custom workflow, and is really nice."

The quality, speed, and, most importantly, the functionality complement each other in such a way that has allowed me to unplug my sheet fed scanner. \n\nI've used many scanning apps including Evernote's Scannable Application, which is in beta stage in comparison to Scanner Pro.\n\nI'm not bashing Scannable, or Evernote. I really like Evernote's concept of having everything accessible from a central database, but I feel as if they should focus more on their Parent Application. \n\nScannable has a good concept but the bugs present are currently intolerable. I would use it just because I didn't know that Scanner Pro did what it can do (I've had Scanner Pro for about two years and it is finally getting the use it deserves).\n\nEvernote, for me, is like many say, a second brain. Scanner Pro's auto upload feature allows me to effortlessly import directly into Evernote.\n\nI then have a Google Drive account linked. Scanner Pro's favorite feature allows me to quickly organize important documents such as receipts into Google Drive where I can access effortlessly during tax time.\n\nI frequently back everything to a external drive, to ensure myself I will always have a copy.\n\nHaving multiple copies reassures me that I won't lose data.\n\nClouds are still not perfect. I've lost data in almost every cloud related software. (Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, Evernote, and the list goes on.)\n\nHighly recommend Scanner Pro!"

As long as your background is a  contrasting color to what you are scanning, it will scan the doc as soon as it finds the edges. You just have to hold it steady. You can rename, email, fax(for a low fee) straight from the app. I have not found anything to complain about yet and have recommended it to friends. It has been a headache and deal savor as I am in the process of moving and buying a new house. When my finance guy has docs that need signed quick and returned, this app has saved the day more than once."

For those that do heavier scanning, the app lacks.\n\nPROS\n- sharp scans \n- share options incl. WebDAV\n- responsive support \n\nCONS\n- too many taps for basic tasks\n- inconsistent work flow & UI\n- takes too much time\n\nIMPROVE RATING:\n\n• Simple indication that a document was successfully uploaded. Instead, requires manual test to see if you get an overwrite request to know it was actually uploaded. Simple check mark would suffice .\n\n• Auto delete once successfully uploaded. Too much time goes into selecting documents to delete after they have been uploaded. Auto delete function exists in competitor apps and it works great. Huge time saver.\n\n• More consistent workflow. Too many taps, sometimes your button to proceed is in the top right, sometimes too left etc. UI needs to be streamlined and consistent. To many taps to do basic actions such as crop adjustment or even save.\n\n-----\nAppears there is not much in the way of user testing or sticking to a plan. \"Wouldn't it be cool if ...\" ideas seem to distract from the discipline and sacrifice that make apps great. No user testing, and you can't trust or count on the app holding to itself long term... 😒 Dev & product leadership have their own way of maturing ScannerPro, which seems to miss the general targets.\n\n-----\nMatt - your review saved me from upgrading. Thank you for the details.\nBtw - rating still shows as 5 stars."

It seemed to do well, but when I looked at the document on the computer about 10 pages were out of focus and had to be done over, and a few more were slightly fuzzy but acceptable. \n\nI decided to try this app based on my positive experience with the developer's PDF Expert. With the exception of one page which was so blurry I noticed it while capturing, so was able to immediately redo it, all 50 pages were razor-sharp. Bravo!\n\nAnother advantage of this app is that it can store/transfer anywhere. Scannable can only transfer PDFs to Evernote, so it requires another step to get the doc where you want it.\n\nOne thing Scannable did better was that it somehow recognized the correct orientation of these weird pages. With this app I had to rotate the pages when done -- an easy job on PDF Expert for Mac."

Comes in handy for me when someone only sends me a picture of a document instead of a PDF version."

This makes is really difficult to accomplish simple sharing tasks, like sending a document to somebody over iMessage. It would be better if the would get rid of their custom sharing UI and replace with iOSs sharing menus.\n\nAnother thing I ding Readdle for with the custom sharing menu is that \"Email\" doesn't work with their email client, Spark. It only works with iOS's built-in email app.\n\nIf Readdle didn't duplicate the iOS sharing menu they wouldn't have any of these problems and be a 5 star app, but it's useless if I can't easily share a document."

The only way is to save the scanned document in iBooks first and email the pages from there. But the HUGE problem is that whenever I scan a bunch of pages the app makes the rest of my phone go haywire for days. I can't access my email at all, it shuts other apps down as soon as I open them, and it shoots my data through the rough where I reach my Verizon data limit in a day or two even at the beginning of a billing cycle. I have to do a reset on my iPhone each time. This happened on both my iPhone 5 and now on my 6s."

Now I can have the same quality image I would expect from our photocopier using this app instead. It is quick, intuitive, and produces documents I feel comfortable using as a professional.

I struggled for a long time to find decent copies of hymns or to take clear photos and scans of hymns that I could print larger. This app is amazing, it cuts my printing time in half at least and produces clear and crisp images every time that I can just email to myself and print. In short, it makes the task enjoyable again. \nThe only thing I would change is the crop feature. I wish that it would allow me to straighten an entire edge at a time and not just corners. But it's a small price to pay for a fantastic app."

I've started to use this to upload deposits instantly to the school districts google drive. My only wish is the option to have each folder upload to a different cloud storage account. I currently have a personal folder in which I upload my financial information and have noticed that it uploads to my work cloud storage.

Just point the camera at a document and if it identifies a document edge for more than a couple seconds it takes the picture automatically. If you have a multipage document you can just flip the pages and the app will scan each new page as it's presented to the camera."

They have not removed it yet.\n\nI updated the app and I have iOS 10, yet it does not send faxes or email me my documents. \n\nWhat's even worse is that the app told me 'fax sent successfully' when it definitely wasn't, and I have over $300 of desperately needed income depending on that fax. There's even a pop-up confirming the $0.99 purchase when it doesn't actually happen.\n\nI gave 2 stars instead of 1 because I at least was able to preserve the documents by saving them to photos. It is also good that the $0.99 payments didn't actually go through, even though the app said they would, so I was protected from at least losing that money."

It does seem a bit slow to be ready to scan as if it needs to connect to the web even though you have not selected iCloud syncing. So if you don't have any service available you still have to wait for it to be ready."

Developers, keep up the great work!\n\nYears later, my review below still stands. Except the app gets better and better! Yay!! Sooo convenient!!\n\nThis scanner truly works best that the others. Trust me, I tested all of them!! So much easier/faster than using the printer and great quality. Document image quality is outstanding. Syncing makes it even faster."

What you get is large crystal clear font, legible, text.  Not a mass of tiny text filled with random characters or a fuzzy PDF.  The article I scanned was narrow - lots of hyphens - which confused the other apps completely such that they couldn't make coherent words from hypenated ones, or figure out the hyphens at all.  This app created complete words from hyphenated ones.  No other app results came close to this one - I only had to make one minor correction.  Fast, accurate.  Stellar!\n\nThank you for an outstanding OCR experience."

Use to take them home and fax them. It was a pain. Not to mention sometimes loosing them before sending. Now as soon as I get in my truck I pull out my phone and use this app to scan and send a PDF copy to my office. Also can send as a image file. If I need to add an image or another PDF page I just send the file to PDF Expert. \nAnother great feature is text recognition. I haven't used that much. One thing is it has to be printed text. But does a fair job at it."

Being able to scan and upload pdfs so easily has made it so easy to keep my documents.\n\nBasically if you're interested in making your document library digital, this is for you.  The automatic paper sizing works even better that previous versions and it is very easy to correct in the event it doesn't.  You can do color, greyscale, or black and white and the automatic contrast/brightness is spot on 98% of the time. Changing the document orientation to landscape/portrait is super easy and I use this any time I want PDFs with varying orientation pages, something I can't seem to find how to do with a non Acrobat Pro program/app.\n\nThe absolutely only glitch I've seen is that on a rare occasion if a corner of a document is mostly blank the program smudges a different color.\n\nThanks Scanner Pro!"

The feature also allows you to switch after scanning between all four of those modes to save as needed. 2). The cropping and brightness/contrast settings are definitely easier than I have seen on a desktop scanner and app. All these features may be available in an office scanners, but having it on the iPhone is definitely the most cost-effective and efficient method I am aware of!"

        "content": "I use Scanner Pro on a daily basis to keep records of daily receipts, vendor/product bills, manuals, and any other important papers that I receive. Once I've copied them they go in the trash or shredder. I've been doing this about two years and my paper records have ceased to grow.  Each year I move the scanned records for that year to a file elsewhere to keep the Scanner Pro folder to a manageable size. This method works very well for me--I have immediate access to all my files.\nNear the end of the year when the app's folder gets larger and before I've moved the files in the folder elsewhere, it takes a little longer to open. Similarly if I'm scanning in a large document to a vendor file, I have sometimes experienced the app crashing. But these problems are minor. I do recommend when starting a new file for a vendor to save it early on with a proper name--if you do this, then any additional scans to the file will automatically be saved--if the app crashes you won't lose work."

Sometimes I can upload all my docu,nets so quick to Egnyte and some days when it uploads my documents it uploads them in a million pages instead of one PDF. I can NEVER send documents through email they never go through. The only thing nice about this app is that you don't have to resize documents manually and there's no watermark. Other than that there are so many bugs. Please fix this issue it makes my life so much harder having to make separate PDFs out of a million individual pages your app didn't separate even though they were scanned in as such. This has been going on for so long I might just go back to cam scanner. I don't know how this got so many stars because it's the buggiest scanner app I've ever used. EVER."

It helps my remote communications (out of the office) look professional and crisp. I no longer use my desk scanner. This is faster and easier! \nI am totally amazed at the quality and pleased with the simplicity and flexibility of this app. Thank you to the developers. \nI don't know if this makes a difference, but I use this app with both the small iPad Pro and, more frequently, with my 15\" iPad Pro."

Seems the more docs you have saved the slower it gets...(update 2017-05-04).\n\nSending the scans via email hasn't worked so well recently. The emails never arrive. \n\nSo I've been uploading to Google Drive instead. This is an okay work-around. \n\nAlso, it's been crashing occasionally, perhaps because 50 or so scanned documents in it but that doesn't seem like an unreasonable amount. It should be able to handle 1000s of scan IMHO."

The automatic picture taking is my favorite feature.\n1/28/2017 This is still one of my favorite apps. I use it to scan documents when I want them in digital form. I lay the report on the floor with each page up. Then I hold the phone over each page in order. The app focuses, takes the picture, and is ready for the next page. A 10 page report will only take a few seconds."

I couldn't open it until I sent a message for help (which they were very helpful), & then I had to delete it & reinstall it & now it works OK. If you save everything to the iCloud all your documents come back, that's pretty cool. I still recommend this scanner app above any other that I have tried as well as what other people tell me about the ones they use. I tell them to download Scanner App Pro over any other. \n\nWhen Apple went to the new (10.1 whatever the number was) update\n\n1/7/2016 - I really appreciate the way that you have continually upgraded this app. Since I started using Scanner App Pro I have turned many people on to this great tool. \n\nThanks for what you do & can't wait to see what's in the future. \n\nPaul \n\nThis app is the best $6.99 I ever spent in my life. I was texting a scanner to my computer and then having to put my papers and each one at a time and then trying to save it properly and then I found scanner Pro and it changed everything. Now I can scan 1 page, 5 pages,10 pages doesn't matter how many I need to do, in a matter of seconds because of the way that this app is continually being upgraded it just keeps getting better and better and better and better. Once I scan something I can email it, texted it or fax it, doesn't matter what I need to do to send it it's a matter of just clicking a button and off it goes. I highly recommend that you get this app you will definitely be happy you did 👍👍👍👍👍"

I think it's a great concept. I'm just not sure I went with the right company, maybe the OCR needs to be upgraded. No other issues or problems with the app, though. I will surely enjoy it when everything is updated with the OCR."

I tend to agree because I can email scans to myself and they work fine but trying to transfer using imazing (formerly disksid) only produces odd named files. \nChanging the naming preferences in the settings doesn't help.\n\nI use this app all the time, several times a day.\nSince the last update file names are not correct. Under settings you can select from templates but none are working for me on my iPhone 6 with the latest iOS. I have tried several templates and I have rebooted my phone but the names continue to be 000.jpg 001, 002.....\nWith each new session the numbers start over so I wind up with duplicate named files and when I try to transfer them my computer won't allow that and makes a mess for knowing what the files are or when they were created.\nTested some things myself and I'm finding that the problem is probably in how the file is named and \"imaging\" can't figure it out.\nAny chance the developer can contact \"imazing\" and figure out what the problem is?\nEverything was fine before updating my phone."

        "title": "High quality scans & continued commitment to maintenance from the developers", 
        "content": "I am using elements of the same review for the PDF Expert app and the Scanner Pro app because together, the two apps make research much easier for students, archivists, researchers, etc. Reviews for each app contain comments for specific features but as a whole, the ability to scan than immediately label, add notes, and organize materials from your phone (and then save to a cloud drive) has made organizing archival research much easier - anyone who has emerged from archives having a hundreds of photos or copied paper documents will appreciate these two apps. The reliability of the app and included features let's me use this for non-research purposes like sending excerpts of books to friends or creating duplicate copies of documents signed in person (leases, etc.). \n\nAs far as scanning apps go, Scanner Pro specifically is the best because of a superior scanning mechanism and various features that result in fairly high quality PDFs even when printed. More often than not (and that's what I have come to expect from apps) Scanner Pro app reliably and accurately detects borders, flattens/smooths any scans of curved pages, and OCR is fairly good in creating searchable PDFs. What makes Scanner Pro superior to other scanning apps, both free and paid, include editing options that improve the quality of any scanned documents: preset page sizes (A4, letter, etc.); adjusting brightness, contrast, page borders. Additionally, the app has many sharing options and reliably maintains access to various cloud storage services. I like the options to create workflows like \"Upload all documents to Dropbox folder and then delete,\" which helps me stay organized. \n\nOne feature that I would like added is the ability to set the page size when editing scanned images. Yes, you can adjust the settings for a default page size - generally, this is fine yet I don't always remember to do this before scanning an odd-sized book, and it seems easy enough to add the option \"set all pages to X size\" to the editing menu. The GDrive text recognition mechanism never works but this could easily be the fault of GDrive and not Scanner Pro; moreover,- Scanner Pro's native OCR has worked well enough that I don't need or miss the GDrive option. \n\nFinally a note on the price: the upfront, one-time purchase prices for PDF Expert and Scanner Pro (I think that I purchased these as a bundle) have been justified as I've used both apps enough to offset equivalent scanning and copying costs. What makes PDF Expert and Scanner Pro apps different from similar apps has been reliability functionality in terms of native features as well as app maintenance, something that has really dropped off in the past years for many types of apps, even paid ones and even ones that require a subscription. I highly recommend paying upfront for these apps because you will receive reliable features and regular updates, and hopefully prevents any price hikes with other apps when regular features suddenly become new \"premium\" features that you have to pay for again. Readdle's continued functionality and commitment to updating these apps means that  they are confident in the products and services that they provide and I am more likely to trust Readdle digital products in the future."

Very intuitive auto cropping with good manual cropping if necessary, nice logical workflow to select file size, color/grey scale/high contrast modes, and seamless automatic upload to my Google Apps account (optionally other cloud services can be used as well). Also, it has a good file management system to mass delete scans that reside on your phone after the cloud upload has been completed. \n\nI'll admit that when I'm in my office, sometimes I'll reach for my iPhone/Scanner Pro scanning solution before using my desktop scanner!"

I am about 3 years in as a user and - even as a stay home Mom, I use one or more of these Apps EVERY day!\n\nI scan receipts, homework, ads, photos - I convert URL links, screen shots and files to PDF, I am INFATUATED with Prizmo too.... You cannot go wrong with Readdle! \n\nRoll the dice, flip a coin, close your eyes and choose at random. Whichever one you try first, will undoubtedly be the beginning of a beautiful, lifelong friendship! 😉👍\n\nSince loading all of Readdle's Apps back in 2014, I have only used my computers/laptop a handful of times! As the owner of a $300 Fujitsu \"Scansnap\" scanner, you would think the two would be incomparable. I no longer use my high end scanner. I even prefer the app for converting my daughter's 100 page workbooks to PDF!! \n\nI'm not a blogger, not a reviewer, not an affiliate of any kind. But - wholeheartedly; I love their products so much - I would work for Readdle if I could! I love their Apps enough to guarantee you'll love them the same! \n\nMeg 👍😉"

Brilliant the way it deskews an image and removes perspective. it's almost fun to use. Very well thought out. \n\nUpdate: 2/10/2013 STILL Awesome. Use for nearly everything I need to digitize.\n\nUpdate: 4/19/2014 just gets better and better. Save every receipt I get to Dropbox.  My \"Go To\" app to digitize.\n\nUpdate 7/14/2014: still the best. Just works. Absolutely the best scanner app on the market!!\n\nUpdate 5/12/2015: features just get better and better!!\n\nUpdate 8/7/2016\nContinued greatness.

Auto crops to page size. So fast. \n\nHighly recommend above other scanner apps out there."

It never actually scans when I tap the button, it just continues to readjust the blue outline around the page. It only ever manages to finally scan when I'm moving the phone quickly away from (or sometimes towards) the page, which causes blurring. I have to sit in front of a single page for several minutes, moving the phone towards and away from the page over and over again, to get a single scan. Working with this app simply takes too long to make it worth it. It gets two stars for the quality of the few scans that actually do work correctly, but I can't recommend this app at all."

Uploads automatically to your choice of cloud storage, and easily shares via email or text. Can also create PDF's from existing photos in your picture library.

Senses when document is within range, no balancing the margins like other scan apps.\n\t2. No need to worry about items along edge of document, you get a clean white straight and balanced result.\n\t3. Takes a picture (scan) of just the document not item(s) outside that you may see through the camera.\n\t4. Able to move scans into folder(s) of your choice.\n\t5. Also able to continuous scan and collect all the pages into one document, and in the sequence they were taken.\n\nThe developer of this APP did a top rated superb job!!!"

The rapid transmission to the cloud of your choice. It also crops the image automatically & you don't have to push a button to take the shot. It crops & activates by itself, you just line up the document & hold your cell still, it does the rest. You can name your document & as soon as you hit save, it on the way to the clouds, less than 2 seconds  on a single page, I uploaded a PDF 11 page in 3 seconds.\nThank you for reading."

To top it off the iMessage feature is also extremely nice for quickly and effortlessly sharing scans with only a few taps. \n\n10/10 app, I would have paid much more for it."

I scanned a series of documents related to a bank account which are missing from the library. My guess is that I thought I had saved them and had not. A delete button can be found now and then, but it does not function well, so deleting documents no longer needed is either difficult or impossible.   The quality of many documents is poor. You cannot scan with a light on in a room, as shadows are extreme. Finding borders is cumbersome. Despite a successful and fast wi-fi systsem in this location the scanner seems unable to connect. Scanner Pro has left me up a creek with no paddle in a very time sensitive and high value transaction. It does back up to dropbox."
