For those who may not be familiar with metadata, : date created, date modified, size of file, location of image, and in some apps such as ProCamera can actually show you from which compass point you were pointing the camera when said image was taken. And this actually works.  All to often whence an image is copied to a program, an app, or another device or drive this valuable metadata is lost and you simply see date created- today. Even if the image was taken 15 years ago. \n A truly remarkable application. \n Definitely DagNabbitRabbit🐰 Approved"

But this is not the case with Google Drive. It tells me the update is there, I try to download it, it tells me I only have iOS 10, so it downloads the last iOS 10 version, then the cycle starts over again. It rediculous because I\\'ve re-downloaded the same iOS 10 version of the app four times before I realized what was happening. I\\'m sure this is a flaw of this particular app and they way the comptible versions are listed in the app store because I have not had this problem with any other app, which has an iOS 11 only version."

This is the 2nd app that will NOT UPDATE, on my iPhone 5/iPad 2 because Apple obviously won't give older Apple hardware devices an updated iOS.\n\nInstead of recognizing there are some of us still out there loyal to the Apple brand, we are being forced to decide to buy new Apple hardware, or another non-iOS brand. New iPhone 10, $1000+??!!! I think not, unless it can clean my house, and run errands for me?!\n\nIt's all about corporate greed for the all mighty $ my friends. Don't waste your time or money on Apple products anymore! Amazon just released a host of affordable gadgets and devices. A 32GB 10\" inch Kindle Fire starts at $149 and with a micro SD card you have enough storage options to buy several tablets, before you reach the price of 1 decent iPad.\n\nI've never used android, or any other smartphone or tablet other than Apple. I do use a PC.\n\nI've been saving my $$ for a new 4K TV with all the cool features, the iPad, and the new iPhone 8, 8+, or 10 (X), costs as much, or more than some of the latest 65\" TV's on the market right now, sans OLED technology.\n\nWhat has Apple done lately? The recent keynote proved to me there is no reason, nothing truly innovative to compel me to upgrade my iPhone, or iPad for that matter.\n\nNow that I'm losing apps on my iPhone 5 and iPad 2, I'd like to thank Apple for helping me decide. That's right, THANK YOU APPLE FOR YOUR DISLOYALTY!!\n\nI'm going to buy a Kindle Fire or a Samsung Tablet to replace my IPad 2. And I will buy a Samsung Galaxy  8+ or Note 8 with superior displays, storage and cameras for far less $$ and superior technology. After all, it's probably made on the same assembly line as  many Apple components, and I won't have the expectation that it will last or be supported for years! Hasta la vista baby! RIP Steve!"

        "content": "My daughter is obligated by her teachers - not only to set up Google Classroom for individual classes with total parent participation) via their district supervised - assigned Google (Gmail accounts) now in middle school, she has accountability to get instructors for when/how/what she did for homework before the class starts that morning. Work parents and the particular teachers can see in real time that yes she did this or that work. Public education online- not online education just streamlined with Google Drive!  No paper need be turned in like last year. (Thank goodness)  It is amazing what is being done now- parents heard rumors since kindergarten and we all ran out and bought our 3rd and 4th graders Chrome Books - But the most awesome thing, is that I as a parent, am invited from day one this year - to keep up with her assignments via school loop/and signing up with all the referrals for Pearson success net/ Google Classroom/ various other online study guides and practice test workshops with my child's classroom teacher-provided log-in. Last year, I had to comb through her entire backpack  daily to find all the paperwork she\"forgot\" to give me to sign, requests for supplies due by a certain date, her Report Card I was supposed to sign that I hadn't received it the parent-teacher conference appointment I never got. What kids are learning now is what I had to go to college for and I'm a grateful single parent for every Google Classroom/Drive/Docs/Sheets/Gmail accounts made for these purposes. This is the year it all is finally coming together! 7th grade, streamlined- online homework assignments with teacher provided log-in for each student (and parent) to log into, study practice tests homework assignments submitted( without paper!)  homework is assigned done and submitted all within Google drive! Thank you God! Last year, was a nightmare - instructors attached assignments in Word format as a word document that my daughter could not convert on her Chrome Book! So if I didn't already have a PC with an active MS Office with Word, she couldn't convert it to a Google Doc to work on it at all, and If I couldn't print an assignment, my daughter had to email it to her counselor at school and show up 15 minutes early in the office to request the emailed printout of her homework assignment for her home room class!!! It been assumed, that each home not only has a personal computer and a functioning printer with ink and paper but of course, WI Fi, (not so!) I'm on permanent disability with once a month social security income. I rent a room (we share a bunkbed) for my daughter and I to live in another families home (that is considered homeless under the McKinney-Vinto education act, by the way) and yet Google makes small miracles happen when it all comes together for the greater good of our children's higher learning!  I am blessed to have an amazing 12 year old that WANTS to be her best and says she loves Science/Math (even though it's really tough she loves the challenge) AND is auditioning for lead singer in her 7th grade Choir. Dreams do come true, since kindergarten at age 5, she said \"I want to be a Rock Star AND a Scientist when I grow up!\" It's happening!!! I thank you, Google - everything!!! My daughter is 12 years old and learning what college kids barely got exposed to if they took the College Prep classes - like I did! 🙌 amazingly wonderful blessings for today's children!!!!"

I thought I’d post this review in hopes that people who have the same issue I’ve had might see it and have an easier time figuring it out than I did?"

It's free and it works perfectly every time. It's kind of insane we can do all this, actually. \n\nI keep expecting I'll miss MS Office, especially Word's substantially more robust feature set, because I make a lot of documentation professionally and I depended on Office for many years. But it really hasn't happened. I use Google docs for everything and now I really depend on the universal accessibility Drive affords. I'm not transporting any more files on thumb drive, forget it. Life is easier, the birds are chirping. So thanks Google! I know you're making a mint off my small contribution to your Big Data set. But what the heck, I wasn't using that anyway. And I am using this. Regards."

        "content": "Updated Review: 9/22/2017\nEver since the recent update last week, Google Drive wants to capture any file attempted to be opened opened on Apple's iCloud drive and save it into Google Drive. There is no opt out available, you have to shut down the app and delete Google Drive from your iphone if you want to open an iCloud app file. This bug renders the Google Drive app basically useless. I trust Google developers are quickly trying to resolve this problem.\n------\nThis is a great general storage app, but I have found it to be slower in overall syncing than Dropbox or MS one drive.  Google needs to take a few lessons from Dropbox and provide faster sync, provide password protection for shared links, and a few other advantages that DBx has. All need to provide better scaling price plans for needs between 1 Tb and 10 Tb. Why not have 2, 3, 4, 5 Tb plans for a single account also? Or better yet, bill users for the actual space used rather than paying for the unused maximum available storage plan? My needs scale up end down and I hate to pay for unused storage. If Google did that, I'd consolidate all other accounts to Google!\nBy charging users for the maximum storage ceiling rather than the storage space used, Google does not need to provide cloud storage hardware for the actual plan need, thereby selling unused the same unused storage capacity to multiple users - how fair is that! It is like a grocery store charging you for a full shopping cart when there only a few items in it a checkout :("

That makes the File Manager useless,  The only fix, unfortunately, was for me to delete Google Drive.

It is now using a “share” view, which seems like a box within the file system. It would be better if the interface is sort of like the website version with all the folders icon in the built-in file system."

This used to be my go-to app for photo backups because it used to keep the photo quality and resolution intact without downgrading the resolution - much to my disappointment, the photo quality is fine when uploading to the drive but now photos are downgraded when you download from Google Drive back to the iPhone. This is very disappointing because it used to keep the fidelity intact. Seems like the new Google Drive app developers are riding in training wheels or cutting corners. Does nobody notice these things or does nobody care?\nI won\\'t be using this app until this is fixed. So disappointed with this app lately."

It is not very difficult to move files, to change their name, or to share them, which is nice. Some problems I run into include  weird temporary files taking over my folders. This is something I run into outside of the app too. Google Drive does this thing where it creates tons of temporary files when you open a file and clogs up your space. This can make things very confusing when you\\'re trying to sort through files on this app. Also I accidentally deleted a bunch of pictures one time and didn\\'t even realize it, so I\\'m very careful when I\\'m on the app not to click things. Dropbox is definitely preferred but there\\'s not enough space on there for me to just use it. Drive has met all my needs without too many issues."

Very sad.\n\nLastly, the documents become Google formatted and can be viewed by the recipient as a Google Doc or Google Sheet.\n\nIf the Drive allowed standard attachments in original format, it would be flawless.\n\nI am always told anything attached from the Drive can't be viewed easily or the format can't be taken in. Most things sent from my Drive are not received or viewed easily (if at all) even when permissions are given.\n\nFinally, it does not work with sites like LinkedIn or any API based platforms. The attachments from the Drive are automatically marked as an unreadable format.\n\nIt is very, very, very sad for a company like Google to have this problem.

That only happened once and not sure if the actual color was due to Drive or UPS's printer. I recently had to make color copies at Staples and everything worked out well.

The only trouble I\\'ve had is that sometimes the desktop app stops syncing for no apparent reason. Exiting and then restarting the app will resume the sync, but this shouldn\\'t happen at all. I have to say that it seems to happen less with Windows 10 than it used to and it\\'s not a particularly frequent occurrence anyway.  If it weren\\'t for this minor issue, I\\'d give it a 5-star rating."

This is very disappointing because it used to keep the fidelity intact. Seems like the new Google Drive app developers are riding in training wheels or cutting corners. \nI won\\'t be using this app until this is fixed. So disappointed with this app lately."

        "content": "I love this app and use it a lot but my heavy usage has made me find 2 bugs that are somewhat irritating. The first one was that I was working on a poster in Google Slides that had the dimensions of an A1 piece of paper. Opening that file on a computer worked well (except for the fact that in order to zoom in you had to actually zoom out which made the functions at the top smaller but when trying to zoom in it doesn't work) but when I tried opening it on my iPad it crashed my springboard and it took 10 seconds for me to be back on my home screen. My second issue, which I experienced on both Google Docs and Slides (Not Sheets since I don't use it really but it might be there too) is that when trying to remove files from the Recent bar at the top (even though these files were already deleted) or the Shared With Me folder, the files would not be deleted and I would have to close the app and then open it again but then even after that some files that I had deleted come back again and I have to delete them again and again. I even had an issue with the Recent bar that didn't allow me to delete 2 of the files there and I tried over 20 times (deleting them then closing the app and opening it again) and the files still don't want to go away. Now although the second issue is not a deal-breaker for me and I can still use the app with it. The first one does affect my work and even though I don't work with A1 sized pages a lot it would be nice to know that I can open the file from my iPad and edit it. (By the way I have an iPad Pro 9.7\" so performance shouldn't be a problem as specs wise the A9X chip is just a tad slower than the A10 chip). Yet again I will still continue to use Google Drive/Docs/Slides/Sheets and they are much better that the Apple alternatives."

Without the previous issue this app is great!\n\nPrevious review:\nVery dissatisfied with the last 3 updates- Google Drive used to be my \"go to\" to app for backing up all my iPhone photos. Sadly, I noticed with the new update there are some major flaws that didn't used to be there. First: I like using iPhone's built-in photo editing features. I use them all the time because they are versatile and they allow edits to be made to a photo without downgrading the file size/resolution. However I noticed after the latest Google Drive update that if I upload an edited photo (say I made it black and white), Google drive will upload it in its original form without the edits. This is a HUGE inconvenience for me. \nSecond: it used to be the case that if I upload new photos to drive, it would maintain the title of the file as it appears on my iPhone. So before I could just upload photos any time and they would be alphabetized correctly and chronologically. Now, it uploads all iPhone photos with random titles, most of them titles \"Full Size Render\". What this means: if you try to upload new photos into a drive folder with pre-existing photos, you will manually have to rename any new uploads if you want your photos to be correctly alphabetized. This is time consuming and inconvenient. \nI never had these issues before."

On this app however, all I get is a bunch of empty squares. No file name, date, preview icon, or anything.  Selecting an empty frame gives me a cryptic file name, and then attempting to \"open in\" or simply view the picture results in the app freezing up and doing nothing for long periods of time.   The desktop website portal is faster and better... unless you want to give google the ability to inspect every photo you ever take, and be able to use the camera in your device anytime they feel like it.\nAs soon as the app is installed, it sets the setting to upload every picture on the device to ON by default.  The resulting upload steals data from my plan, steals private photos, and jamms the cellular data link so I cannot do anything about it except pull the plug (airplane mode) then search for and cut off the auto upload function(s) \n ."

        "content": "Very dissatisfied with the last 3 updates- Google Drive used to be my \"go to\" to app for backing up all my iPhone photos. Sadly, I noticed with the new update there are some major flaws that didn't used to be there. First: I like using iPhone's built-in photo editing features. I use them all the time because they are versatile and they allow edits to be made to a photo without downgrading the file size/resolution. However I noticed after the latest Google Drive update that if I upload an edited photo (say I made it black and white), Google drive will upload it in its original form without the edits. This is a HUGE inconvenience for me. \nSecond: it used to be the case that if I upload new photos to drive, it would maintain the title of the file as it appears on my iPhone. So before I could just upload photos any time and they would be alphabetized correctly and chronologically. Now, it uploads all iPhone photos with random titles, most of them titles \"Full Size Render\". What this means: if you try to upload new photos into a drive folder with pre-existing photos, you will manually have to rename any new uploads if you want your photos to be correctly alphabetized. This is time consuming and inconvenient. \nI never had these issues before."

This must be the exact reasonwhy I cannot get responses to resume that I sent out. I am blaming 100% my frustration of not being able to acquire employment on both Apple\\'s refusal to allow users to store files to their iPhones and Google drives restriction on file sharing from their services. I refuse to allow this to continue anymore. Starting from my next device I will no longer be utilizing any Apple devices. And I will refuseto utilize to drive for any cloud service.

If I was listening and put my phone to sleep, after turning the screen back on, if I used any of the lock screen commands (Rev 30, Play/Pause, For 30) the timecode would freeze. Then upon unlocking the phone (iPhone 6s) to control in app, pushing any button would reference the frozen time code (sometimes 10-20 minutes backward).\n\nI love Google Drive (10/10), but I'm at 2 stars so that this is hopefully looked at for feedback.

        "content": "Google Drive has been a wonderful app for me to store my files, especially music MP3 files. It's a great place to be able to organize songs by band names, genres, and subgenres. I loved that I could download my songs offline and listen to them in the car or wherever I went without waiting for the file to load. I have enjoyed using it and have many songs there to listen to. However, when I went on the app today, June 14th, I discovered a new update overnight. I was excited and hoped that there'd be something of interest. Instead, I found that whenever I close the app or my device goes to sleep after inactivity, the song stops and I have to keep google drive up on my screen to continue listening. This is infuriating to me. Now when I'm just doing things while listening to songs, I have to keep the app open and my device awake at all times, which is completely pointless. This will cause my battery to run down faster and I can no longer do anything while listening to music. I listen to music over 7 hours a day, and am often doing other things while listening, especially during school. Now with this app, I won't be able to listen to music while doing schoolwork since I can't leave the app and have the music continue. I am very disappointed that google has changed this, and would greatly appreciate if it were updated back to where videos can continue playing in the background. I will give 5 stars if this is changed, as I have loved this app, but since now it's going to be quite difficult to listen to my music ever, I have to give it 1 star. I will continue to deal with the app at this time as it will take hundreds of hours for me to get all my songs again in a different place, but you have just made a pointless decision to make videos unable to play in the device background. This is all I wanted to say. Please change this. I can't say I'd recommend this to anyone since I just have wasted hundreds of hours on getting music files on an app that at the decision of the company, has just made it a pain to even bother with. Put your music somewhere else if you're considering this app unless google changes this. With the state the Google Drive is in now with this change, I'll have to tell everyone I've recommended this app to to not bother with it.\n\nEDIT: I see google has fixed this change with their latest update. Very happy with this. Will give the app 5 stars again as it is a great app to use to place MP3 files."

I do not have this problem on my computer, but... why make this a thing?\n\n2- I'm not loving that audio files can't be played in the background while I'm doing something else.

        "title": "Wonderful app, but quite upset with new update", 
        "content": "Google Drive has been a wonderful app for me to store my files, especially music MP3 files. It's a great place to be able to organize songs by band names, genres, and subgenres. I loved that I could download my songs offline and listen to them in the car or wherever I went without waiting for the file to load. I have enjoyed using it and have many songs there to listen to. However, when I went on the app today, June 14th, I discovered a new update overnight. I was excited and hoped that there'd be something of interest. Instead, I found that whenever I close the app or my device goes to sleep after inactivity, the song stops and I have to keep google drive up on my screen to continue listening. This is infuriating to me. Now when I'm just doing things while listening to songs, I have to keep the app open and my device awake at all times, which is completely pointless. This will cause my battery to run down faster and I can no longer do anything while listening to music. I listen to music over 7 hours a day, and am often doing other things while listening, especially during school. Now with this app, I won't be able to listen to music while doing schoolwork since I can't leave the app and have the music continue. I am very disappointed that google has changed this, and would greatly appreciate if it were updated back to where videos can continue playing in the background. I will give 5 stars if this is changed, as I have loved this app, but since now it's going to be quite difficult to listen to my music ever, I have to give it 1 star. I will continue to deal with the app at this time as it will take hundreds of hours for me to get all my songs again in a different place, but you have just made a pointless decision to make videos unable to play in the device background. This is all I wanted to say. Please change this. I can't say I'd recommend this to anyone since I just have wasted hundreds of hours on getting music files on an app that at the decision of the company, has just made it a pain to even bother with. Put your music somewhere else if you're considering this app unless google changes this. With the state the Google Drive is in now with this change, I'll have to tell everyone I've recommended this app to to not bother with it."

        "content": "Google Drive has been a wonderful app for me to store my files, especially music MP3 files. It's a great place to be able to organize songs by band names, genres, and subgenres. I loved that I could download my songs offline and listen to them in the car or wherever I went without waiting for the file to load. I have enjoyed using it and have many songs there to listen to. However, when I went on the app today, June 14th, I discovered a new update overnight. I was excited and hoped that there'd be something of interest. Instead, I found that whenever I close the app or my device goes to sleep after inactivity, the song stops and I have to keep google drive up on my screen to continue listening. This is infuriating to me. Now when I'm just doing things while listening to songs, I have to keep the app open and my device awake at all times, which is completely pointless. This will cause my battery to run down faster and I can no longer do anything while listening to music. I listen to music over 7 hours a day, and am often doing other things while listening, especially during school. Now with this app, I won't be able to listen to music while doing schoolwork since I can't leave the app and have the music continue. I am very disappointed that google has changed this, and would greatly appreciate if it were updated back to where videos can continue playing in the background. I will give 5 stars if this is changed, as I have loved this app, but since now it's going to be quite difficult to listen to my music ever, I have to give it 2 stars. I will continue to deal with the app at this time as it will take hundreds of hours for me to get all my songs again in a different place, but you have just made a pointless decision to make videos unable to play in the device background. This is all I wanted to say. Please change this."

This issue only occurred since the most recent update.\n\nThere's another issue I've had for a while with audio (when I could still play in background / control from iPhone home screen). If I was listening and put my phone to sleep, after turning the screen back on, if I used any of the lock screen commands (Rev 30, Play/Pause, For 30) the timecode would freeze. Then upon unlocking the phone (iPhone 6s) to control in app, pushing any button would reference the frozen time code (sometimes 10-20 minutes backward).\n\nI love Google Drive (10/10), but I'm at 2 stars so that this is hopefully looked at for feedback. Seriously though, thanks for a great product. Hope to continue using for all things, audio included."

I am not sure if it is because it is a larger screen or more pixels in the iPhone, or just the app, but nether the less the videos are all pixelated. Second is that it takes too long to open videos in another app. Third, recently the app is nolonger showing a thumbnail for any video I have uploaded recently. Other than that, it is a great app, and highly recommend it"

        "content": "Google Drive used to be my \\\"go to\\\" to backup all my iPhone photos. Sadly, I noticed with the new update there are some major flaws that didn\\'t used to be there. First: I like using iPhone\\'s built-in photo editing features. I use them all the time because they are versatile and they allow edits to be made to a photo without downgrading the file size/resolution. However I noticed after the latest Google Drive update that if I upload an edited photo (say I made it black and white), Google drive will upload it in its original form without the edits. This is a HUGE inconvenience for me. \nSecond: it used to be the case that if I upload new photos to drive, it would maintain the title of the file as it appears on my iPhone. So before I could just upload photos any time and they would be alphabetized correctly and chronologically. Now, it uploads all iPhone photos with random titles, most of them titles \\\"Full Size Render\\\". What this means: if you try to upload new photos into a drive folder with pre-existing photos, you will manually have to rename any new uploads if you want your photos to be correctly alphabetized. This is time consuming and inconvenient. \nI never had these issues before. Very disappointed with the new Drive version. I hope they fix this"

Every download of those alternatives should be considered a vote against managers who stifled internal google efforts to innovate along those lines. To the credit of the new collaborative improvements at Google Drive you can request updates for any doc you want to monitor closely , but it is not the default, so you don\\'t have an Updates stream like that feature in Quip."

Google needs to take a few lessons from Dropbox and provide faster sync, provide password protection for shared links, and a few other advantages that DBx has. All need to provide better scaling price plans for needs between 1 Tb and 10 Tb. Why not have 2, 3, 4, 5 Tb plans for a single account also? Or better yet, bill users for the actual space used rather than paying for the unused maximum available storage plan? My needs scale up end down and I hate to pay for unused storage. If Google did that, I'd consolidate all other accounts to Google!\nBy charging users for the maximum storage ceiling rather than the storage space used, Google does not need to provide cloud storage hardware for the actual plan need, thereby selling unused the same unused storage capacity to multiple users - how fair is that! It is like a grocery store charging you for a full shopping cart when there only a few items in it a checkout :("

I simply want to copy files I plan to use for a week to my mobile device, so I don't have to mix it with the files sitting on my device.\nGD allows that. It is quick and dirty. Copy the files to the GD directory on my desktop, within moments I am able to leave my abode and use the files.\n5 Stars for that easiness.\nI do not know the ins-&-outs of the GD app but I am not a fan of its resident audio player, and it seems to have a problem finding, thus using by default, the audio player I installed on my iPh6s+. Because its resident tool for using the audio files sitting within the app cannot find and thus use a very popular audio player I am subtracting 2 stars. When that gets fixed I'll modify my review\nThank you."

        "content": "Google Drive used to be my \"go to\" to backup all my iPhone photos. Sadly, I noticed with the new update there are some major flaws that didn't used to be there. First: I like using iPhone's built-in photo editing features. I use them all the time because they are versatile and they allow edits to be made to a photo without downgrading the file size/resolution. However I noticed after the latest Google Drive update that if I upload an edited photo (say I made it black and white), Google drive will upload it in its original form without the edits. This is a HUGE inconvenience for me. \nSecond: it used to be the case that if I upload new photos to drive, it would maintain the title of the file as it appears on my iPhone. So before I could just upload photos any time and they would be alphabetized correctly and chronologically. Now, it uploads all iPhone photos with random titles, most of them titles \"Full Size Render\". What this means: if you try to upload new photos into a drive folder with pre-existing photos, you will manually have to rename any new uploads if you want your photos to be correctly alphabetized. This is time consuming and inconvenient. \nI never had these issues before. Very disappointed with the new Drive version. I hope they fix this so I can go back to rating it 5 stars."

Then it was a try to delete the app and restore via my backup. Still no luck. I tried downgrading to the last supported iOS 5 version 1.5.0. Nope still refuses to sync.  Ironically, my computer syncs fine. \n\nI'm lost at all words because like I said my iPod is my newest apple device and, I don't have money (and won't for the next few years) for a new one. I try to get support and its like a gigantic middle finger in my face. \n\nFortunetly, I have other apps I can use but man, why do you have to abandon support for someone who cannot afford the newest iPhone or iPod"

It seems to be CPU/mem intensive, it seems to temporarily hang, and if I click away or the screen locks during an upload it fails. The throttling for up/downloads is also a bit much.\n\nThere aren't really any better options. But, it's Google, and you know they could do better. Good enough, isn't good enough."

It like another review said, when you open the app it looks like its ready to go but you tap and nothing happens. You then have to wait for the \\\"quick\\\" (slow) access to appear before you can do anything at all. Really frustrating!! Please get rid of quick access I don\\'t use it and never wanted it. Also the photo uploader is buggy. When you click on a photo you want to upload a check mark will appear but soon disappears. This is an issue if you are uploading lots of photos at once. Please fix!"

Don\\'t even get me started on calendars. I run a family of 6 with a job that takes me out of the city often if not more, a husband who has a crazy work schedule and a teenager, no comment there. Everyone gets to be where they need to be thanks to Google Calendar. There isn\\'t a more efficient calendar to use for families. I even share with the grandparents for they can\\'t attend sports event or recitals."

It opens and it looks like it is loaded, but when you tap, nothing happens. Then your recent documents show up across the top and you can tap or scroll. I\\'m assuming that feature is slowing the app down. Not only that, but I don\\'t want that feature. Sometimes you don\\'t want to open the app and see a preview of what I have recently uploaded/updated. This is made especially frustrating when the app acts frozen. It creates a potential situation where the app is frozen with files you do not want displayed."

Being able to access certain paperwork when away from the house has saved me lots of time.\n\nHaving so much information centrally located and being able to access it all from anyway is amazing! \n\nAnd you get it all with your FREE email account!

I use Dropbox and iCloud too, S3 too come to think of it, but none of those give me the joy I get from Drive. I especially like not having to launch another app to view a doc, watch a video or listen to an mp3. When sharing files like videos, music and documents on gmail you can view them right in the window with the email, without having to download it first. Bored yet? I could go on....

It is not very difficult to move files, to change their name, or to share them, which is nice. Some problems I run into include  weird temporary files taking over my folders. This is something I run into outside of the app too. Google Drive does this thing where it creates tons of temporary files when you open a file and clogs up your space. This can make things very confusing when you\\'re trying to sort through files on this app. Also I accidentally deleted a bunch of pictures one time and didn\\'t even realize it, so I\\'m very careful when I\\'m on the app not to click things. Dropbox is definitely preferred but there\\'s not enough space on there for me to just use it. Drive has met all my needs without too many issues."

Google Drive is faster, but I like the \\\"look\\\" of OneDrive better as your folders feature a photo that is within the folder as it\\'s dashboard identity. \nThe only issue I\\'m having with the app is that it constantly crashes when sending files to the trash, and that = four stars.

        "content": "I have enjoyed using Google Drive at no cost since its inception and have always been appreciative of the use of its software and storage.  Almost as user friendly and intuitive as Apple products in terms of practicality. I have not found that the word processing or office app facilities are able to function as well as MS Word and hence still use the others when I can.  For a \\\"free\\\" service you simply cannot complain.  I am now running over my 15GB of free storage and am having to bite the bullet and pay for service. Still, $1.99 monthly is not too high a price to pay for a TB of storage.  What bothers me the most is that there is no way to pay for this on an annual or even multi-year basis. Instead we are required to go monthly - and with automatic debit.  I find that very similar to the \\\"closed system\\\" that is Apple and something that I had hoped Google would differentiate itself from.  To say I am disappointed would be an understatement. I hope that Google will reconsider this policy and provide multiple ways to pay for the service when the time comes."

Highlight multiple tracks, then play them one at a time. Repeat and shuffle would be a bonus! \n\nI\\'m on an iPhone 6s Plus. : )"

It allows for the filing & keeping of an online; personal record of all important documents that are also able to be shared via email.  This has become the eliminator of piles of paperwork stacked up everywhere. Due to my currently not having my own laptop; it\\'s been my only means for keeping track of and/or having copies of all substantial material on a computer database/Hard-drive database system enabling transfer capabilities. Google Drive has TRULY been a lifesaver for me over the past year or so. I LOVE IT!!"

December 13, 2016. Google Drive is Better than white bread. We need a continuous button so it can play the next thing in music or video in player.  Also shuffle and repeat would be nice to. Merry Christmas. Thank You to everyone who had a hand in creating this masterpiece. I love my google drive. Google makes it so easy to manage my emails sites here. I also love this for my movies collection. Apple you need to pack up and get out of dodge. Google Drive is the absolute best app in storage out here. I have saved 30 gb on My IPad alone."
