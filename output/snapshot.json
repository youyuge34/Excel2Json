        "content": "Snapchat is a great app to connect with your friends and family members, I absolutely adore it. However, there are two things I would like to see change. The first thing is the Bitmojis.  I agree, they are a lot of fun and very entertaining, but, I would like to have the option to change my profile picture to an actual picture of myself instead of the Bitmoji. I know a lot my friends agree with me on this, and this change would not completely get rid of the Bitmojis, rather,  it would allow your audience to have the choice to choose between a gif of themselves for their snapcode, or, their Bitmoji. The other change I would love to see happen is to improve the quality of snapchats being sent. I know whenever I take a picture or video on Snapchat, the quality at first is amazing with impeccable HD and high saturation.  However, after I send the picture or video to either my story or a friend, the clarity of the picture seems to decrease as the picture becomes more blurry. I know these suggestions may seem like a lot to ask, but I know the majority of my friends agree with me when I say it these changes would definitely help your app Snapchat, appeal to a broader audience. I hope you can take these words into consideration and maybe even make a change. Thank you for your time and understanding! \n                                     Sincerely,\n                                        A fellow Snapchat user"

I didn't exactly care for a majority of the conversations I was having. I just wanted to  watch tv. Due to me just wanted to watch my television, I wished to myself that I could customize whose notifications could come through. I decided that I was going to look at the notification settings. As I was on my way to the setting in a doubtful manor, and as I predicted I couldn't customize. Then I started thinking, what if I wrote them a review. In the chance that they might read this and maybe do something about it or at least consider it. I'm suggesting adding a customization option in the notification settings. I have 4 idea I have to take into consideration, in my opinion. My first idea was just simply choosing whose notifications could come through in my friend list. Then I thought about the idea that only my Snapchat streaks notifications could come through. I also considered the idea that only my best friends notifications could come through. Lastly I was thinking about the idea that both my best friends and my streaks notifications could come through. I'm not asking for all of these to be added. I'm only asking one of them to be taken into consideration, and possibly something being added. Thank you for your time."

The new features are cool but I wish you would've left the set up the way it was before this new update. One thing that I absolutely do not like is that when you open the snap it doesn't show the seconds anymore. another thing is how it's set up when you take pictures, or in general.  I absolutely do not like at all that all the tools are on the side now. it's much better at top since it looks neater and now just looks cluttered. I think this was a great idea but you should have kept the set up the same and some of the other features the same, like the showcase of seconds when you open a snap. please and thankyou."

I wasn't just annoyed my gif was gone, but that I couldn't even create a new one. Why would I want to use the Bitmoji as my profile picture? What if someone wanted to make sure that they were adding the right account? They couldn't because there would be no profile picture. The Bitmoji isn't exactly a spitting image for anyone. Please add the gif back or at least give people the option to use an actual picture of themselves."

        "content": "Snapchat, I think you need to make something called add accounts on your app. Maybe where the bitmoji/picture is or the settings. I know many people that agree with me, the reason many people agree with this idea is because many people get their phone taken, and they have to get someone to keep their streaks. Because just because they get their phone taken for a week that shouldn't mean that they have to lose their 200‚ûï streak with someone. So maybe if you would like to go to instagram like instagram did you and copy their add account feature just to see how they did it? I mean no one would blame since instagram did copy you guys. Anyways I think you should make that feature and make it pretty soon like before school starts because children get their phone taken because of their bad grades. So you should make this add accounts feature on your app and those are my reason(s) why. Thank you for your time."

        "content": "I love snapchat, I always have :) but there are a few things that I think would make it even more user friendly. \nI'm a streak addict, so if there was a button that selected all streaks when sending snaps, it would make keeping up with them so much easier. \nI LOVE filters, and I find myself using the same few over and over again. If the filters were in the order of most recently used, it would make selecting them quicker, and more accessible. \nNow, this is an issue I've encountered on my own: My account is public because I have a little bit of a fanbase build up online, so there are a ton of people that I would like to see my story, but I don't necessarily snap them so I don't have them on my friends list. When I have to block certain users (that are on my friends list) from seeing my story, my account becomes private and only those on my friends list can see my story. Then my fans can't see my story. (To get around this I've just blocked users, including my friends, completely) It would be great if I could block people from seeing my story and keep them on my friends list, as well as keep my account public. \nAgain, I love snapchat with all my heart! I use it everyday and I couldn't imagine a phone without it. I hope this review is helpful, and hopefully we'll see some of the features I mentioned in the future! :)"

The \"news\" sources provided are blatantly one-sided as well as ill-informed on the topics they try to cover. Sources such as MTV, Complex, Buzzfeed for \"news\" is not news period! No further explanation needed. Those \"news outlets\" are blatantly promoting vile and just degenerate behaviors and lifestyles, which would be tolerable if this was an adult only app, to all the young users on Snapchat. These displays of hedonism and over-sexualization are unacceptable to be shown to the large young audience that has been drawn to the allure of this simple social media app. The borderline pornographic content of some of \"news\" should be placed where it belongs, in a porn site, and not a massive, popular and continuously growing media platform that contains people of all ages. That's not even mentioning the vomit inducing content such as \"24 things people with big butts can get away with\" and \"women gone truly wild\". I will continue to monitor the apps content for a long time and will continue to voice myself until this is changed appropriately. Once again, fix this."

I'd think that they haven't sent anything at all, but then when I enter the app again, it appears all the sudden. Figuring this was probably just an easy fix, on July 31, I deleted the app, restarted my device, and redownloaded the app. Now, it says \"Could Not Connect. Please check your connection and try again\" when I try to login. I am still not able to login, even on another device that previously worked. I've tried every trick in the book: redownloading the app, restarting my device, checking my connection, flipping between Wifi and data, and resetting my password. Nothing has worked.\nSnapchat has a serious issue, or at least I think it does because I'm almost positive it isn't my phone, and it needs to be fixed ASAP! If anybody is having similar issues, please write a review so Snapchat knows that this is an URGENT PROBLEM. I thought the update would have dealt with this issue but apparently not. I am severely disappointed, and at this moment, even more disappointed with Snapchat's SLOW response to the issues I've presented them.\nZERO stars for customer satisfaction.\nZERO stars for the current version."

I don't care what their annoying stories or snaps have to say in them - I only care to see things from people I can actually say are my friend. You can't face swap with a friend anymore, only with pictures saved in your phone. Snaps deliver slow like super lag, if they even deliver at all. Majority of the time, lately everything fails to send and stories fail to post. Refreshing and loading of snaps or stories takes way too long. If Snapchat doesn't get move on fixing any of the above issues, I will be removing my account with them. I am sure I can get many friends and family to do the same. And I will inform others through social media of this nonsense, letting them know my experience. I will recommend a different app."

Kids would he jailed for child pornography, it would be a scandal. so of course, this cannot happen. the fact is, kids like to be mean, but most kids are too scared to bully in person. sure, they could do it over text or phone, but snapchat makes it private enough for a bully to tear into someone without feeling even an ounce of remorse. snapchat needs to go."

The articles to read are almost all about sex, or nudity. A recent article they had on their discover section was \"How to get Laid for the Holidays.\" why? i'm pretty sure nobody's reason to download snapchat was to read sex stories and see nude pictures of people. Now kids (11-16 year olds; the general population of people who use snapchat) can come across pornographic pictures and click on them without anybody, like their parents, knowing. why does that seem like a good idea. I hate it and i am a teenager myself. Parents have no idea that their kids are being exposed to these kind of things when they are supposedly just \"sending snaps to their friends\". \nI tried looking in the settings for somewhere i could opt out the discover, they don't have an option for that and don't even have a option to opt out adult content on it. It's dumb and if adults want to read articles like that there are plenty of other places they can find one other than on the app that was meant for kids to communicate with their  friends.

This is not a fair and balanced place politically. I'm not a right-wing person, but this is just so far left it's disgusting to me. Also there is a lot of inappropriate stuff for the younger ones using this app. It's just not good to be exposed to this kind of stuff at a certain age and considering that almost every person I know has this app it's rather concerning. I mean how would someone feel on the counter side of things if the ONLY news you had access to on this was Fox News? That would feel pretty biased right? That's how I feel every day I look at this app, it makes me want to uninstall but unfortunately I need it to communicate with friends over seas.

I recommend you slow down a bit and let Snapchat stay a simple app that you can use to send pictures to friends.\n\n2: Discover Page\nThe discover page is so inappropriate it‚Äôs not even funny. Some of the articles are pretty entertaining but others give a terrible impression to the children that use this app. Most of the people that use Snapchat are 12-16 and the things that are in the discover section are not something that 12-16 years olds should be reading.\n\n3: Slow\nSnapchat recently for me had been very slow and laggy. It takes forever for something to send or for the filters to load. Please try  and fix this, I don‚Äôt want to wait 5 minutes for my picture to send.\n\n4: Filters\nOne of the reasons I downloaded Snapchat was for the filters, but recently the filters have been lacking. Some of them are weird, confusing and just plain stupid. Bring back some of the old filters! Many of my friends agree with me when I say that I want more of the old filters back.\n\nOther than that Snapchat is a great app and I recommend you download it.

If I wanted to read those horrible stories id go to their website. As a young user of Snapchat I would love more than anything to get rid of the sex tips and actually show me something important. I can definitely see why it would be a problem for parents the articles are very explicit for children and usually have a false story of women or people of a different race such as \"what women think of sex\", \"why hispanics hate this thing\" and the rest of the majority are stories of the Kardashians....at least give us an option to turn that off it's extremely annoying."

Lastly give us a category where we put people we are having streaks with so you can have a send all button just for the streaks so we don't have to go through and individually click every streak. I'm sure a forced streak was never the intention rather than one that pops up because real conversations but that's what it's come to so please give us a category and another thing with streaks, we should be able to have streaks with a group chat as long as every person in the chat snaps each day if one person fails to snap the streak is lost.

We have to go to the settings and turn on ghost mode, when it should be already on ghost mode, not off of it. Now people that I really don't know have my location, they could've screenshot it, wrote it down, or whatever. It is irrelevant to even have a map of your Snapchat friends on there. I'm no longer even giving Snapchat permission to have my location while in the privacy of my own home, or anywhere else that is a personal location of mine. In addition, I have lost all trust in Snapchat, we give it permission to have our location, and us snap chat users already trusting that it will be kept safe and private, then to have Snapchat turn around on us and throw out our exact location was not smart, and very unsafe."

Secondly it opens my snaps without me actually clicking on it. I'll wait to open some snaps but when I eventually do go go to open them, it says that I already opened them and didn't reply!!! Those are snaps I didn't even see and then the other person thinks I left them on read. Also sometimes I have to log out and log back in cause I know that there are snaps that didn't people sent me but somehow didn't load. And when I do log back in there's a ton of people with the square next to their name where it says that they sent me a snap but I didn't know that cause I thought my snap that I had sent was just delivered and they didn't open it yet but actually they did open it AND reply but once again Snapchat opened it w/o myself actually tapping on someone's name to look at the snap myself. It's really aggravating me that my snaps are being opened w/o my permission and that I'm not being able to see what people are sending me since they are already opened when I go to open it. It's not just pictures either, videos people send me are also being opened by themselves."

Snapchat also has a verity of stuff you can do as you wait for your friends/streaks to Snapchat you back. Some examples are watching your friends' stories and watching the discover stories (buzzfeed, people, ESPN, and many more) yes some of them have stuff about sexual activity and other stuff but it also has jokes, games, and quizzes. And tbh(to be honest-for all those people who don't know) I don't know why some of y'all are hating on Snapchat because of the discover and about how kids ages 11-16 use it most. First off, those kids probably know what that stuff is and it's better than looking it up cause it's human nature. Secondly, if they don't know what that is their going to learn it at some point. So all of those haters need to back off, cause Snapchat may not be for you but to most of the people in this world it's fun/lit(it's when something is turnt, not when you intoxicated with weed or any other drug- just for those who are unaware about what it means now days)."

Even with if turned off, I can still see \"my ghost Bitmoji\" on the map. Just seeing that is disturbing.....AF. Please remove \"my ghost Bitmoji\". I don't need to see that on the map because I know where I'm at. It's creepy because it's confirmation that you-Snapchat-know exactly where I'm at, at all times. I knew that before but now you're showing me evidence that you know where I'm at. Freakin A!! I'm considering leaving and just posting stories on IG.

Second, why is there no seperate section when you send a snap for JUST people you have streaks with? It's so hard to go through my entire contact list every day just to send steaks. Third, it would be so much easier if you could star someone's account so when you go to the Snapchat Stories page it will show their story first? I have a lot of interest in certain people's stories than others and it stinks to go through all the stories just to look at the 10 stories I actually want to watch.

I know I can block some people from my story but I feel like this is inconvenient, especially if it's only one or two snaps that I don't want a certain person to watch, I tend to forget to unblock them after those snaps expire, so I feel like giving me the option to make a story for my family, for instance, and another one for my friends, etc. is so much more efficient and time-saving.

I have no reason to ever create a bitmoji other than to be like everyone else, so I just ignored it at first. However, bitmoji seems to be taking over the app. Snapchat just added a new feature where if you post a story, instead of just the names of the people who have viewed your story, you now get their bitmoji as well. This makes it a lot harder to focus on the names of the people, as so many bitmojis are very similar. It was easier to see the names without the bitmojis there, and quite honestly it's just stupid and pointless to put them by the peoples' names. I say get rid of bitmoji in the story \"viewed\" list, and get it back the way it was before. Quite making everything so complicated."

Sometimes I will not be able to turn down my brightness, and I have no idea why this could be happening.\n\nAnother problem I have been experiencing is I have been logged out multiple time for unknown reasons. I have asked all the people that know my password if they logged in and they all have the same reply, no. It's getting me frustrated. Although this could be an attempt to hack, usually the hacker would change something or do something to mess up thy account, nothing has been changed and messed around with since this has been happening. \n\nThe last problem is that sometimes my streaks disappear for absolute no reason. Even if we have recently sent a snap to each other. Most of the time it comes back later on, but it worries me, even if happens to every high streak.

Another suggestion is I think there should be a public page where you join public groups to make finding friends easier kinda like my story but like a public option and we can joking and post on which ever one we want and there should be restrictions the person who added it to public for anyone not just their friends to join but public.

I deactivated Bitmoji, but it appears to have deleted my Snapcode selfie gif which I've been using since I first downloaded Snapchat, which is a bummer. \n\nAlso some other feedback: I like Bitmoji, but I'm not a huge fan on it appearing everywhere instead of my Snapcode selfie gif. As fun as Bitmoji is and the awesome features it provides, I'd rather have the image I choose represent my Snapchat rather than the Bitmoji's face (As seen on the iOS widget, Quick Chat Search, and now Snapcode, etc). It would be awesome to have a toggle in the Bitmoji menu which allows the display of either Bitmoji or Snapcode selfie on these fronts. After this Snapcode change, I probably won't be activating Bitmoji within Snapchat until something like this is implemented.\n\nThank you"

        "content": "Honesty, I love Snapchat. The app is great, it's user-friendly, fun, and it connects people together in ways that most apps do not. There's plenty of content within the app to make it more customized to your person and it allows for a network of people to see what's going on in their friend's lives. But this political stuff has to stop. All I see is \"Trump's latest screw up\" and \"Trump's new agenda\" and \"Here's what Trump got wrong\" from all these left wing news outlets that are basically front-page on Snapchat. Being on a relatively moderate political stance, I don't mind seeing both sides of the argument. But when it comes to Snapchat all I see in the \"bad\" (if some of it can even be interpreted that way) and nothing \"good\". I have not see one pro-Trump/Republican/Conservative report on the app yet and it honestly feels like I'm having the left crammed down my throat. Nobody goes to Snapchat for the news, and if you do you REALLY need to broaden your mind to more open ideas because anything that comes out of Snapchat is pretty closed-minded. Get away from the political crap, quit pushing an agenda, and go back to just being a fun, lovable app that doesn't take a political stance."

Each person would have their own snap score still, but if you held down on someone's name a number would come up to show how many snaps you have sent just to each other. It could also go up by being in group chats with them, and by viewing each other's stories. \n‚Ä¢ You should be able to see what times people view your story. I know a lot of people who are curious if somebody saw their story immediately or if it was longer. Sometimes people don't check who saw it and by the time they do, so many people have seen it that it's impossible to tell how quickly someone viewed it. \n\nThese are just some ideas I've come up with. I know that they probably won't happen but if someone sees this please take them into consideration! Thank you."

HOWEVER not everyone wants to be bombarded with articles about celebrities asses or how to have the best oral sex. FURTHER why are the majority of the articles on what women could be doing better? The majority of snapchat users are 18 and under teens. Sending young girls the message that they need to change this or that about their appearance to be liked or that there's this formula to a good relationship is NOT productive. This sends the message that a woman's worth exists only in the way she is viewed by others. To push so many articles like this at an audience of hyper-impressionable girls should be considered a crime! We need to be empowering young women and these messages are the opposite of empowerment. When the discover feature was introduced I remember it helped people to get caught up on current events, there was even a National Geographic section, all of which were much more interesting than the crap that is cluttering snapchat now. Ultimately it would be great if the over sexual content was removed completely however creating a feature which allows users to hide certain kinds of articles would be a step in the right direction."

I had less things to worry about, and I feel more relaxed knowing I can live in the moment instead of recording the moment so people can only see it for 24 hours.

I can still snapchat people, use the discover feature, view stories, and post stories. I just can't use the filters. I would greatly appreciate it if this was fixed in the next update. I don't know if this happens to anyone else or just me. Also I hate the discover thing, but only because I takes up too much room on my stories page. I think that since they already have their own page that they don't need to be there twice. I don't care about the majority of the discover things so I don't need them to take up half of my stories page. I also hate that once over 200 people see your stories you can't see everyone who viewed your story. And the live stories!!! Those are huge and 90% of the time they are just about sports or cities. They shouldn't be on my stories page. Overall though. Great app. Just wish the discover things weren't there and that my phone doesn't shut down every time I use a filter."

Then I'll refresh the app and there are more but not as many as was there when I opened it that morning or the first time for the day! I don't look at the stories so that isn't the issue, even if I scroll down to look at the not so recent stories I still can't find them! There will only be like 5 or 6 there sometimes. Please fix this or explain why this happening!!!!! Thanks"

Not on personal snaps, but on stories they did. How many posts did someone make? No one knows now and no one knows how long they last. Idk about anyone else, but I used to look at that all the time to see if I should swipe up to pause the timer and read or look at a post, so not having that anymore is going to be annoying. It was completly unnecessary to remove, so why did they do it? Updates are supposed to add tools, not remove them."

This app is used by adults everywhere, who AREN'T self absorbed. Sorry that you're too insecure to look in the camera. ANYWAY... This isn't personal. A lot of people liked the feature you took away... because Snapchat is still functional, this app will receive three stars instead of one.

I also love texting my friends on Snapchat bc it disappears after they read it, but I hate how they have the option to save my texts, it'd be nicer if I could choose who is allowed to save my text. Also the app says 12+ I think Snapchat should make it harder for kids under 12 to make an account. Snapchat has inappropriate stories almost every day talking about sex and relationships, they also do stories about ISIS, shootings, and politics. In my opinion that's not age appropriate for 12 year olds and honestly I don't think it's really age appropriate for 13/14 year olds either."

Kidnappers, Murderers, and/or Stalkers can see where you are at any time with this feature but, if you don't want those people to see where you are at all times, you have to turn location services off every new update. Many people who have this app are young, as in they still live in their parents houses. Some of them will get grounded, and some of them may lose their phones. If an update rolls in while these things happen, they're in trouble! This is a serious issue that snapchat should actually care about enough to take down the new feature."

Discovering things is great and all, but who said I needed to discover 12 tips for better sex on a story!? I don't need to see that! In fact, many of the story cover photos are so lewd I ignore looking at my friends stories sometimes. Snapchat should make an option that allows you to control which stories appear on your friend page story stream, and then leave the rest in the discover tab, so you actually need to go find them to see them. I would like to be able to pick which stories pop up in my face every time I scroll left. At this point, snapchat might as well get rid of the \"discover\" page as it isn't serving any purpose at all now. Snapchat is an excellent social media platform, but the story section is just too uncustomizable to feel like it's my snapchat. It's some company's."

It constantly mocks republicans and people who don't condone certain standards of today. \n2) GET RID OF MTV. Sure, Comedy Central and buzzfeed are funny and can be a little edgy, which I like, but MTV is the most useless and volatile thing I've seen. I'm 18 years old, but I feel so sorry for the younger teens that are exposed to things that I don't even want to hear about. It talks about sex in disgusting ways. It promotes feminazism, and it bashes people who don't believe in what they believe. It's extremely irreverent. \n\nMy final word is, snapchat, get rid of MTV, and make sure the \"news\" you give covers all the bases and shows BOTH sides of the argument. Thanks"

Third thing is that there aren't any limits on this app. You could posts naked pictures on your story and Snapchat will allow it.

I have been video chatting with my girlfriend on it for a while and we keep getting this problem. So, the only thing I ask is for that to be fixed and that would make this app the best social media app to me.

Also, maybe consider giving us the option of having a set of default filters. Like a limit permanent set of 3 filters that never go away, while still being able to try new ones that come in. Even if it is something we have to pay for. I would pay for that to be able to use my favorite filters constantly, instead of being sad when they disappear.

It should have an thing where the other person and to give permission for you to be able to save something and also I hate when people screenshot can u make it where you can't screenshot chats or stories and also can we have different notification sounds for certain people. I don't like answering people who just send streaks even when I'm not even on a streak with them. I only answer my friends snaps. Also can u make it where u can replay somebody's story but it not show that u did."

Second it will say I have like 40 snaps, I'll go on the app and I only count 20, where's the other 20..? I'll go back on the app later and it opened them, but I didn't actually open them, and I'll refresh it and it will just pop up out of nowhere, I get notifications that I got a snap from a person, but then I go on snap and it's not there. Third I will send streaks out and it will say the person opened it right away... then I'll close it out and go back on and it will say it's still delivered. So I don't know.... is this a phone problem or a Snapchat problem...?"

So if I don't remember which story I was in, it's impossible to pick up where I left off. Very frustrating. What I suggest is simply let the app stay on whatever screen we leave it on.

I don't have kids of my own yet, but I have younger siblings, and it sickens me to think that they see stories talking about which celebrity has been photographed topless, or who's got a boob job, or 10 things that drive women crazy in bed. Just now I popped open the app and saw \"What % sexpert are you?\" and \"9 people share their weirdest hookup stories.\" It's revolting that this kind of deplorable garbage is being broadcast to an audience that Snapchat knows is largely very young. I understand that they have to make their money somehow, but this is classless and disgusting. Add some sort of guidelines or filter to control what is being shown. Or AT LEAST a way for parents to control what kind of stories show up. Step up, Snapchat, this is sad."

Since everyone puts a huge emphasis on streaks now, I really think that chats should count towards your streak and not just picture messages. I prefer to use chats most of the time because you can type way more and there is no time limit to reading the message but sometimes I forget to send a picture message to keep the streak. I don't see why chats shouldn't count towards your streak, you're still talking to that person! \n\nAnother thing, it would be great if you could fix the bug where sometimes Snapchat opens your snaps for you if you've waited awhile to answer and then you don't get to see them. Other than those two things I mentioned, it's a great app! Thank you for listening, I hope you consider my suggestions :)"

That was one of the ONLY ways I could talk to some of my friends! My mom gave me some reasons why I had to delete it, because I didn't really understand why. She told my the reasons, but I think the real reason is because, parents can't monitor their kids. The chats disappear. And so do the snaps.

I understand in order to make more money, advertising needs to happen but that doesn't mean I want to see what is happening with the Kardashians or what the best sex moves are. This is ridiculous. If people want to see this, have them choose to see this. The only option for those of us that don't want to fall into the hyper-sexualized world we live in, is to delete the app. I have deleted it and have had it deleted for months. The pictures and articles found on the discovery page are pornographic in word and image. There are so many children and young people with moldeable minds that are being taught that sending nudes, promiscuity and being more \"sexy\" in bed is the only way to have a healthy sexual relationship. This is not how the rising generation should be receiving their sex education. Snapchat has turned from a fun innocent social app to a money hungry conglomerate that is normalizing the objectification of humans. I will download and give a better review again when the discovery section is optional. This one small detail really tanks this potentially great app."

I've been a Snapchat user since it first started and without the timer in the top right corner it's really hard to determine how long something is and if there's more to it. It's pretty annoying. Add it back, please! I don't know what the purpose was for taking it away. \nAlso another thing, it's hard to add people on my Snapchat if I can't see who they actually are! You guys are taking the \"bit\" thing way too far, it's ridiculous!"

Plus this NEW Location map is dangerous if people think they are just sharing a general area location with people they are WRONG!!!!! You are Sharing your EXACT LOCATION WITH EVERYONE!!!!! Even if the person is not your friend there are glowing dots on the map and you can see everyone's stories in that area so be carful. Since there is not a way to just opt out yet I put myself on Ghost Mode so I hope that at least blocks people from seeing my location but I definitely warned my friends and they all did the same because we all thought it was super Creepy!!!! I say snap should just stick with the sharing of the major event stories and the location stories where your friends and there friends can add in that location if you wanted them to!"

But lately its cons have been heavily outweighing it's pros. \n1- SNAPCHAT OPENS MY SNAPS (OR SAYS THAT I OPENED THEM) IF I LEAVE THEM UNOPENED FOR MORE THAN A FEW HOURS. seriously? not sure if this is a glitch or supposed to happen but maybe I wanted to see those snaps? what if there was something important?\n2- THE NEWS IS INCREDIBLY BIASED. not all snapchatters share the same views, so featuring such biased news is very offsetting and even offensive to some users. Every last news source featured leans so far to the left that it's very tempting to get rid of snapchat. There are many young snapchat users and they most certainly should have access to news that portrays all sides of the stories rather than only showing them articles that support what some snapchat executive believes. aka 1) get rid of news or 2) get more sources that don't all publish such biased views or 3) make a block feature\n3- APP CRASHES FREQUENTLY!!!!!!\n4- THE CAMERA BUTTON ONLY WORKS ABOUT 80% OF THE TIME"

Snapchat has changed so much from its early stages and I absolutely love it; there are so many cool new features like augmented reality filters and custom stories. However some old features that were removed were loved by the retro snapchat users. The best friends list was one of my favorites.

As you can see snapchat with every update your reviews are getting more and more negative which does not look good on your part. So, please fix these things and listen to your costumers. And one last thing the discovery thing is really and waste of space and the live stories and I hate how you have to look at every single story and I can't just choose who's I want to view.

It could also go up by being in group chats with them, and by viewing each other's stories. \n‚Ä¢ You should be able to see what times people view your story. I know a lot of people who are curious if somebody saw their story immediately or if it was longer. Sometimes people don't check who saw it and by the time they do, so many people have seen it that it's impossible to tell how quickly someone viewed it. \n\nThese are just some ideas I've come up with.

It goes against all the progress that has been made to stop the objectification of women's bodies; not to mention putting pornographic content in the hands of young boys whose parents may be unaware of the dangers hidden in plain sight on this app. If you are a parent I strongly urge you to ask your children to delete this app. To the snapchat creators: stop putting adult content on an app that you know all too well has a majority user-base of adolescents.

        "content": "Please note I attempted to send a review to the creators of SnapChat several months ago. It seems they did not take my opinion into consideration whatsoever as nothing has changed. Clearly, after reading a few other reviews I am not the only one who feels this way so I'll say it again. Why? Why is this would-be brilliant and unique form of social media and communication becoming nothing more than a sell-out for biased and unreliable \"news\" feeds? The majority of the \"news\" that appears is completely biased and very much leans to the left. If there is to be a news feed on a social media site, let it be, at the very least moderate. I am fed up with the ridiculous levels of unwanted \"news\" and \"stories.\" They are not needed. Please find an alternative to them, or as I said I would several months again, I will delete my account and encourage others to do the same. Please, SnapChat developers! Take away the biased and unwanted \"news\" stations on what was once a nice, fun way of communication that was (quite wonderfully) devoid of political scandals that ought not to be propagated online. Thank you for your consideration, and please heed this this time, I beg of you. I do not wish to remove my account, but I shall if this issue is not addressed."

        "content": "I second the concerns and complaints about the explicit content on Snapchat. The magazine content (which users have no control over) that is displayed right under friends' snapchat stories are often explicit without so much as opening the article. They feature barely-covered women and an overwhelming number of sexual images. And that's only the small pictures of the articles...the articles themselves are far too frequently informational articles about sex. If this were an app that only adults used, I would be less concerned. But my little sister and her middle-school friends often use Snapchat as their primary method of communication. It troubles me that they may stumble upon these kinds of images and articles when just scrolling through their friends' stories. I don't want my sister to see a naked Kylie Jenner and learn about sex positions at her age--honestly, it's exploitation. Snapchat, the idea behind this app is wonderful! But you need to know your audience. Know who you're feeding and what you're feeding them. Does Snapchat really need this trashy magazine content? I certainly do not believe so. That's not what people want when they download Snapchat; there are other apps for that. Please, please censor what your viewers are being exposed to! If nothing else, allow users to choose what content appears under their friends' stories. Something needs to change here."

It will replay snaps from a few days ago and only play them over and over. Everybody has to leave and rejoin the chat in order to fix issues. Then on top of that the app drains my battery very fast. A 10minute session would probably drain at least 10%. The app is slow. The news section doesn't make much sense as the \"news\" in there is very biased.(mainly towards feminist and minority's). Like one \"news\" thing was \"3 things only us black woman know\". And then there is a bunch of stuff on \"man spreading\". I think that they should add an option to turn off the news and they should add a clear chat history thing to group chats. (If that's not a thing already. I don't explore options much) I'm not sure how much they can do about how fast the app runs. I probably just need a better phone."

I never looked at the Discover stories, as they had their own page, separate from the Stories page where you view your friends' snap stories. It was great when you didn't have to see the Discover stories if you didn't want to. However, there is no longer a separate page for the Discover stories, and they are displayed in all of their glory right next to your friends' snap stories. This *really* bothers me, particularly because they are quite frequently (actually on a daily basis) vulgar & filled with sexual content. I don't want to see that on the stories page, and judging from many other reviews I read, a lot of Snapchat users don't want to either. I always loved Snapchat before, but I actually deleted the app because of this reason a couple of months ago. I see that many other people feel the same way, and I think Snapchat should listen to this criticism, and not force-feed the disgusting Discover stories to their users. If this is ever changed, I will happily re-install the app. But until then, I'm enjoying my life Snapchat-free. :)"

I have sent snapchats to the wrong people before because it will lag and i think i'm sending it to someone else. Also i think its stupid how when i first got snapchat 3-4 years ago, i was able to see who some of my friends best friends are. It was actually interesting to know who people were talking too... but anyways snapchat keeps people up to date with whats going on in the world whether its political, tv shows, and or cooking. People now adays cant live without snapchat, and i cant wait to see how much it improves in the future!!!"

I know the purpose was solely to protect people because, not gonna lie, I would also want to know. However, I‚Äôm lowkey offended that it now tells you when someone records their screen. Now, shady people can continue doing shady things and if I catch them, they‚Äôre gonna know!!! That‚Äôs the only flaw I have with your app. Like I said, it‚Äôs my favorite. I use it everyday, more than any other app. Plus, can we please bring back the face swap filter?"

I do not appreciate political and social propaganda being shoved in my face. There are many things of a mature and/or sexual nature that are inappropriate for people like my ten year old little sister who has a snapchat account on her iPod. Not to mention, the reason I have snapchat is to connect with friends, like the majority of users. NOT to be socially informed. Snapchat automatically downloads these sponsored discover stories which uses more of my data than I want. I know I am a part of a substantial group of people who do not appreciate having discover on our snapchat. I enjoy being able to share photos with friends via snapchat, etc. Myself and many others would be willing to pay for an ad-free version of snapchat in order to have no ads or offensive and inappropriate discover suggestions."

To do that, I'd have to restart the app again and again, and it is plain annoying. Another problem is that if I were to take a good photo with/of my friends/myself with a FILTER on it, and I don't like it, I basically press the X button. Pressing the X button will remove the filter, but we find our/my faces nonfiltered and frozen right on the screen, instead of getting ready for another picture.

It shows I am located in the middle of the ocean and has been since I have got the new update. It's not just on my end either, to everyone it looks like I am in the middle of the ocean. 3. Snapchat did not send out a warning, nor did they tell you how to turn it off. I just recently found out about SnapMap through a friend. I find this highly irresponsible. And when it came out, everyone should have already been in ghost mode and then had the choice to turn it on. I don't like SnapMap in the slightest bit TBH, but hopefully it will be grow on me?

I really dislike both of these functions because they are so inconvenient and prolong the amount of time it takes to respond to my friends. Another thing that annoys me is how whenever I manually speed scroll down, I tap someone's name to stop the scrolling, then I tap their name again so I can open their snap, but what happens rather than the snap opening up is that I open to the camera. I'm getting really sick of that constantly happening, especially because in one of the older versions of snapchat, the double tap to camera feature only worked when the screen was unmoving (was not scrolling). I had decided not to update for a couple months and then when I did finally update, snapchat became so annoying and I would have most likely deleted it or neglected it if it weren't the only way for me to communicate with some of my friends. So all in all the past updates leading up to this one have progressively made me more and more annoyed and frustrated with the app."

This is EXTREMELY inconvenient and annoying to have to deal with. And finally, sometimes a streak will end and I'll have no warning. Sometimes a timer will show up even though we have snapchatted multiple times yet the streak still ends for some reason. Also, the timer will not show up or we'll both have snapped a lot that day and somehow the streak will be gone. I use this app daily, but I won't anymore if these bugs don't get fixed.

I've been forced to just guess what I'm typing, send the message, and correct myself afterwards. My next issue is what it has done to my camera quality.. I have an iPhone 6s Plus, and it has made my phone quality look like that of an iPhone 5, at best. My last issue with this is that now I'm unable to use the flash when taking pictures. I will try to, and it will freeze on the screen and the flash will stay on, but no picture will be taken. Then I have to shut my app down to use it after trying to take a picture with flash. I would appreciate if these issues were taken into account when creating the next update for the app, because I used to love this app and these issues have made me use it much less because I cannot stand these problems.

I would very much appreciate the ability to better edit what is shown in the section so I can remove what is indecent and inappropriate. Though the featured scroll allows you to hide one by one, it doesn't seem to allow you to fully block them nor does it completely remove them from the Discover page.

A lot of stories are not shown or disappear when I go through them all. I'm really disappointed with Snapchat lately..."

Also, there are some clear battery problems with Snapchat, not just when using the app but also in the background. I have tried turning off background app refresh, quitting the app, turning off notifications; nothing stops the running in the background. This needs to be fixed. \nOther than that, I really really really like Snapchat. I think it could definitely be improved, but overall it is a pretty good app."

A monster known as \"Discover\". Discover terrorized all Snapchat dwellers (commonly known as snapchaters). See the reason why the evil developers created Discover is because they stopped caring about their users and wanted to make money, so they decided to sell out. Not only that, but they decided to place discover in the heart of Snapchat, the stories page. Discover is terrible and feared because he is very politically biased, sexist, boring, and never stops talking about the Kardashians, Snapchaters don't even have the option to decide what sources to view. Since the creation of discover, the people of Snapchat have been sad and depressed, and most of them are leaving Snapchat to go to another app that isn't plagued by the evil Discover: Instagram. Instagram provided a safe heaven for those who were traumatized by Discover. Instagram currently is the far more better option for those looking for a fun app to communicate with friends, make stories of their days, and send the self destructing messages that everyone loves. What will the developers do? Are they going to watch the world of snapchat burn and its people terrorized by the evil Discover? Or will they realize that they were wrong and try to restore Snapchat to its previous glory? To be continued..."

Or (or) an audio sign if it has sound to it and a muted audio sign if it does not. I think about this often when I am opening snaps at the wrong place at the wrong time.... ALSO VERY IMPORTANT ON THIS NEW UPDATE I use snapchat every day and here recently with the ability to record six frames at a time when I sing songs and post the whole story they will post all out of wack and I don't like taking the all that time for it to post unaccordingly... I love Snapchat, I'm good at it and I make people's day but this is a problem... so 3 stars"

It's such a hassle going into settings ro remove them one by one. I personally like to keep my streaks and favourite friends always open. I remove everyone else after our chat has ended so as not to have a giant list of people to go through.\n\n2- Why isn't Snapchat looking into the block list? I have had way too many inappropriate snaps sent to me and blocked those users, yet Snapchat seems to do nothing with the block list. I'm pretty sure if I'm receiving unwanted inappropriate snaps from a user then they're sending them to others also. Sync the lists up, Snapchat! Geez! Remove these people and don't allow them to access to their account again."

This was a big issue that needed to be fixed, so I applaud the company for resolving this. \nHowever, there is still a slight issue with the fact that sometimes  if I do not open my snaps for about an hour or more, they will automatically be marked as opened and I cannot retrieve them. This is not necessarily a huge issue, but sometimes people send me important stuff and I need to be able to read it. \nAlso, can we please change our usernames??

I think Snapchat was a great idea and was executed perfectly, until some of the latest updates, including stories and news from completely biased sites. CNN and other liberal media sites have been integrated into this app to mainstream completely biased information, brainwashing the young kids who use this app. Yesterday, Snapchat added the opinion of an unimportant writer from a foreign country stating that the odds of Trump's impeachment are 80% in the first six months.  Absolute nonsense. This shows that Snapchat will put almost anything on their app to push their agenda that Trump and all white male conservatives are horrible, racist people which is delusional and racist in itself.  I understand that the Snapchat business is a liberal cesspit but I am very disappointed in their attempt to push a perspective that is so extremely biased even if it means frustrating conservatives and losing the money of people who delete the app because of the news mainstreamed on this app. All I can ask and hope for is that Snapchat will remain unbiased or just get rid of the extra news and go back to a time where people actually enjoyed  opening this app"

Its not going away on their phone though, only mine.  It's making me unaware if i'm actually loosing a streak with someone or not.

        "content": "I believe snap chat is a fun way to socialize with friends. You can send pictures, chats, videos, and even where you are and what your doing added recently. You can also extend the time in which people can see the snap chat. You obviously use filters but you can also cut out something on the picture and save it as a sticker! When you chat it goes away when somebody reads it but you can also save chats. When somebody screenshots something you can see it and you do t have to follow people back if you don't want to you can block people and you can have best friends on sc also, the stories are nice, they have public ones like buzzfeed, brother, consomplation, etc. you also can post on your own story and make a story more than one person can post on. You can have group chats and Bitmojis! In conclusion snap chat is safe for people to use and it is a great way to communicate and connect with family members and friends."

So if it goes off when I take a pic/video I will have to retake it or it will just be gone forever. \nOther than these issues snapchat is a great app and I love it, but these 2 issues had brought it down 2 stars and hopefully you will read this and solve the issues and then I can give you guys a 5 star review, or you can do what you did in the past and forget the issue and it will just get worse and worse. \nSo please resolve these issues and all will be good, thanks !"

Fake news is slandering and lying and corrupt so why is no one taking action. Everyone is too busy out marching for the wrong things like abortion but they won't fight for the truth. I bet they don't accept my review because it's \"unacceptable\". At least I'm telling the truth but it seems like they're trying to hide it. I bet if the news bashed Obama then there would be rioting in the streets but when the media does it to Trump us republicans put on our big boy pants and get on with our day and don't act like snowflakes."

I use Snapchat to connect with friends - what it used to be for - not to get news or hear about some celebrity I don't even care about. \n\nI understand many people like this feature, but to meet in the middle ground, it would be VERY helpful to create an option to hide or unhide the discover page and all the events/publishers' stories. This way, if people don't wanna see the daily news from the discover page and the publishers' stories, they don't have to. But if people want to see that, they have the option to unhide it.\n\nPlease consider this - because the discover page/subscriptions/world events/publishers/celebrity coverage will be a deal breaker for me to stop using Snapchat. :( and I don't want to do that which is why I am writing this!\n\nThanks Snapchat team!"

Whenever I try to take a picture, or ESPECIALLY whenever I try to record a video, the entire app begins to lag very badly. I would press and hold on the record button, and it will take at least 10 second for it to begin recording, and even when it does, the video is all laggy as well. Then when i try to delete the video, that just causes more lag and more problems. FINALLY, when i record what i want, without any lag, I try to add a caption, but the keyboard becomes unresponsive and horribly slow. The snapchat stories also lag. This app version was NOT optimized for older iPhone users in mind, which is very upsetting."

It'll allow me to share or delete it, but it would not let me edit it. No matter how many times I clicked it, it wouldn't do anything. Right after that, I deleted the app. When I downloaded the app again, the same problem was happening. So I decided to restart my phone. When I did, it allowed me to start editing the pictures. And when I tried to take the multi snaps (six 10 second videos), it would only stop at one. The new update didn't work. The other features did, but not the multi snap...

This was noticeable in the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida; none of the parks' filters show up for me or my friend, but they've all been showing up for my brother! We've checked our phones and snapchat settings, they're all the same. It's not a matter with out phones. It's only showing the Orlando geofilters and one for \"Bay Lake, Fl\". Last I checked, that's not where we are. The geofilter problem comes up at home in Missouri, too, so it's not just a localized issue. Just thought I should mention this, because it's kind of disappointing to not have the magical geofilters to go with our magical experience in Disney World :("

I know for a FACT we both sent each other snaps yesterday. Snapchat recognized a problem but refused to fix it; this is horrible public relations. I will continue to use the app as it is the main way to connect with my friends, but I have lost all respect for the company due to their lack of interest in their supporters. This app deserves a 0/5 stars simply due to the horrible people at the company. If you have problems with your streaks or anything else, DO NOT expect the problem to be resolved.

When I first started using snapchat, I wouldn't ever take pictures of my face because I thought I was ugly, but my friends helped me overcome that.  However, with the addition of the \"Featured\" section, I find it ridiculous that you are advertising these articles that show off women's bodies and have \"advice\" for how to get in a relationship or how to dress for other people. This gives unrealistic expectations of how women's bodies are \"supposed to look\" and shames normal people for how their bodies look. You are just helping society objectify women and I find this ridiculous to setback what we have worked so hard to do. Women have jobs, women are so successful in the world right now and apps like yours do not help that cause. Please remove the Featured section."

What I don't love and what brought my review all the way down to two stars is the new way that Discover stories are featured. When they were hidden or even just displayed as small circles it was fine to have some adult-ish content. But now every time I open the app and go to my stories page, I'm guaranteed to see a fully naked Gigi Hadid or a barely clothed Kardashian or some sort of sexual image or article. And there's no way to control it or hide these images. I should be able to let my 9yo sister look over my shoulder when using the app without hiding the screen and parents shouldn't be afraid to let their kids open it. Ive seen enough of this kind of content over the past few weeks that if I didn't use it for messaging some long distance friends I would delete the app altogether. It might be time to look for alternatives."

Just disappointing how Snapchat seems to think throwing sexual content out for the world is cool... fed up a tad seeing naked women every time I want to look into some current events.

        "content": "I find this to be a very practical and unique form of social media, however, I find it a little dry on features. Sure it has the stickers and face-swap feature and the friend map and bitmojis and video calls and private messages and stories and featured shows and news articles and special effects -- but where's the human spirit, or rather, the bitmoji spirit? We humans have been using these bitmojis for far too long as servants to our culture, but we never allow them the freedom to explore the boundaries of their own psyches and take chances by themselves. We dress them, we tell them what to say, and we may think it's fine because they look less than human, but for someone such as myself who doesn't see race, I find this disgusting. It's clear that you're limited in gestures to apply to new features -- you've already used pinch-to-zoom, swiping in every direction, holding, and double tapping. Sooner or later you'll have to branch into other spacial dimensions. It's just inevitable. What I propose you invest in, once you've of course overthrown NASA and CERN in engineering modular bionic fingers for more gestures, is artificial intelligence. There will be a point in your business's growth at which users will have exhausted every actual friendship they have, as they will have unthinkable amounts of stickers and filters on their hands soon enough, meaning more than enough friendship and socializing for a lifetime. What your corporation's fabrication of the first artificial super-intelligence could do it bring true sentience to Ghostface Chillah, the famed Snapchat ghost. With this there would be no need for friends any longer, and ultimately, the real world itself. We could live in what I'd like to propose be called a \"cybersnap matrix\". A world beyond what we currently know of the physical world, but what will soon be child's play to you with your impeding technological revolutions. Here, humankind and bitmoji kind could grow and evolve together...side by side. We could help to finally free their people under the tyrannous regime of man in assisting bitmoji Abraham Lincoln to emancipate them from other bitmojans. We could be there to witness their bitmoji Neil Armstrong take his first bitmoji steps on the bitmoji moon under the loving majesty of Ghostface. And yes, I know what you're thinking, 'what if these bitmojis wage war on humankind? Are we safe from these primal savages after all we've done to them?' And it's now we must consider that all they know of culture is us, thus all they can be is us. So ask yourself, are we safe amongst ourselves? Is society fluid or is it always in some way binary in the eye of the beholder? Don't forget what you've learnt here of our world's own destiny. Until then, may Ghostface have mercy on us all, for until we try breaking free of this charade, we could be in the cybersnap matrix as we chat.\nKeep up the great work,\nAdrian"

So many snappers have a lot of steaks (I have 100+) and there should be a way to add users (all of your steaks) in a \"streaks\" category, and just press the \"streaks\" button and it automatically sends it to everyone. Kind of like the new group chat update, but without adding every one to one group, if that makes sense, haha. Thanks for listening!!"

I tried to close the app and reopen it, but still had the problem. Overall, this app has taken huge leaps backwards and at this point it seems as if Instagram live has caught up to Snapchat or maybe even surpassed it.

However most of the time the filters are made to change your face in cartoonishly feminine ways. There's nothing wrong with that as is, but dudes have very few options. For instance the current male target filter pinches your chin, enlarges your eyes and removes eyebrows with the hope of redemption by adding a beard... this isn't always a problem but I personally prefer a little less cosmetics in my pictures. Even a few more neutral filters without the male target would be great. Like the B&W with the circular shades. It doesn't ruin the app, but it's the one peeve I have."

If I am not friends with you on snapchat I don't necessarily want you to be seeing my story... \nI like the articles that you can read like from buzzfeed and cosmopolitan and things like that, I think that are fun but recently for example with the election all the stories are entirely one sided, and for those of you reading this I am not saying I agree with the out come of the election or that I don't agree but the articles recently are all one sided being all against trump. I would rather see it from both perspectives than see every article just entirely hating on one person. On the articles as well there is a new way to go and flip through the let's call them \"pages\", where if you tap on the right side which is a larger part of the screen it will go to the next page and if you tap on the left side which is a smaller section, it will go back to the previous page. Why did you even change it to this? Just being able to normally swipe was easy and nothing was wrong with it at all, so why was it changed?"

The only thing i have an issue with over snapchat is when im on the verge of losing a streak snapchat doesn't tell me about it so I lose that streak things that it was fine. I believe snapchat should start sending you notifications when you are about to lose a streak cause it is not fun losing a streak that you have worked hard to keep and it just slips right of your fingers. So Snapchat please keep this in mind when you are making a new update"

I feel like it's less user friendly now . I don't even feel like going through everyone's snaps and watching them anymore cause it seems like more of a hassle .

        "content": "Before the filters and the constant news feed Snapchat had the highest rising popularity rate on the market. Not only was Snapchat an app you could connect with friend on via pictures, but it also was a way to depict your emotions and favorite pictures in a mere snapshot of your life that you could place on your story. However, this is not the case today. It is clear Snapchat is a follower not a leader, as are most apps on the AppStore. We see Instagram trying to become more like Facebook and Snapchat trying to become more like Instagram and Facebook trying to become Snapchat. But isn't there a reason we have all these individual apps anyways? That's what they are, individuals, and I wish they kept their individuality. That's what makes them unique. The newest update on Snapchat has me in a way angry, but I'm really just disappointed. The icons on the snap screen cover every picture I take and are just in the way, more so than when they were on the top and bottom. Don't get me wrong, change is not what I despise; after all this is a changing world. What I don't care for is the clutter. Pointless news feeds take up the right swipe screen and I can barely go through my friends stories without accidentally clicking on one. Overall I am not impressed with how Snapchat has changed since the original versions have come out. Updates such as filters and the chat feature have been the best upgrades to the app, but they should've stopped while they were ahead because the Snapchat we have now will never be the one we used to know.."

This is a problem because it makes me rewatch stories that i already played through! \nAlso, my streaks keep disappearing when I've already snapped that person that day. Plus, when ever I add people and they add me back, I can't see their score. So it makes it hard for me to know who actually added me back and who didn't.. In addition to all of this snapchats been logging me out lately. Which kind of scares me... Pls try and fix these things.."

        "content": "Snapchat is a great app, and an excellent concept; even if the app sucked, so many people use it that it couldn't really be effectively boycotted. Every once in awhile snap will send a picture/video to the wrong person, so if you plan on sending sensitive things, beware. A feature i'd recommend to the snap team as a practically addicted user would be priority contacts; you could turn off notifications for all but certain people, and/or have custom notification sounds/vibrations for certain people, too. It would come in handy in circumstances where I want to take a nap, but need to talk to one or two people; I could turn on priority mode and fall asleep, knowing I wouldn't wake up to everybody hitting me up, but at the same time wouldn't miss the important notification. Hopefully snap sees this, cuz they often implement recommended features"

I cleared the cached data and was left with 400MB, where the app is 120MB And the remaining 280MB is documents and data that I can't clear. Besides that, Discovery, snapcash, and the new map feature are just absurd things and attempts to copy other services or attempts to monetize. Snapchat needs to take a step back and chill out."

It is not easy to monitor on this app. Especially if you are busy this app is helpful because you do not have to do any scrolling. You can see new recipes, see what is happening in other countries, and the look at the political world, based on who you follow and what you subscribe to. No money is involved. I would recommend this app to anyone and I hope this review will help you decide whether or not to get it."

Stories are supposed to show you other people's lives/days but how can I keep up when they disappear without a trace. You can't even search the person and then watch their story, it is just gone.

One of these is that our parents may take our phones away, simply for the reason that we do not own them. This makes our streaks die, which is really frustrating, especially if you are close to 100 days. My idea is that there is a setting called \"Parent Possession\", which, when activated, puts a message on your story saying that you parents have a hold of your phone right now and that you won't be able to snap anyone. However, the other thing that this setting would do is send, once a day, a snap to your streaks. The person on the other end would have to reply, of course, but it could possibly save your streaks until you regain possession of your phone."

That's a lot of work especially to add back all those people from our old Snapchat. So can y'all just please allow us to change our usernames even if it's just a minimum to it like Facebook does . Another problem is that with this update it keeps sign you out of Snapchat randomly and I don't know why . Three get rid of that location bull because it's putting people in danger.

It makes me wanna use Instagram Stories instead just because of that, the video quality on there is much better, the quality that Snapchat used to have until some time early last year it diminished. Don't know the reason why but just get back to that decent quality, or your snappies will convert to IG-ies forever!!! Also, don't show the actual time the snap was created, it's too revealing.

I have lost many streaks with people without knowing bc i didn't see their flame and numbers when i was scrolling and that's my story. Those 100 days gone to waste üò≠üò≠"

Man, in just one day, just because that CEO said one crappy thing, Snapchat is going down. And just watch, because in around 2 decades, India will be one of the top countries in terms of wealth. At that time, we won't need your Snapchat because it's too cheap for us. Very disappointed."

I was locked out of my account after receiving a warning saying that if I continued to use the snap save app I would be locked out. So I deleted the app, the next morning I was locked out. I contacted \"customer service\" and expected a person to respond to me. I received an email where clearly the \"person\" had not read what I said, it did not help me at all, just repeated what the first warning said. So I wrote in a complaint, even though there is NO WHERE to do such a thing, and I received the same exact  automated email as before. If there is an issue with your account there's nothing you can do about it, because they have no such thing as real customer service. I also was not aware that I could not use third party apps anymore when I was given the warning to stop. But why was I locked out for an entire day when I listened to what the message told me to do? Not very fair. Stop selling out to news and the Kardashians and make snapchat PERSONAL again!"

Also, everyone's review that says \"The news is posting too much half naked celebrity garbage\" but honestly it's just a human body and you guys should just get over it. In the new update I like the feature that shows you can make A playlist of people stories instead of automatically getting someone else's story that you might not have wanted to see. So yeah, I use this app on a regular basis and I just wanted to review it. Here ya go."

This is soooo incredibly annoying and needs to change to how it was before. I liked to seeing a list starting from the first viewer to the most recent one. Many people also agree to this because there r many articles I have read which shows many costumers complaining about this issue and threatening to stop using the app as well as reporting this issue on Twitter. THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE !!! Snapchat will be my least favorite app to use which makes me very upset to say because I truly LOVE this app."

Snapchat definitely needs to give their users options to customize their newsfeed. Another issue that I've been having is the video.  The video feature lags a lot! Ever since the new update, I've been getting notifications everyday saying that a new friend has added me. However, when I click to see who it is, there's nothing there.  I'm not getting any requests at all and I know that people have added me.  This is extremely annoying.  I only gave it two stars because I do enjoy snapchat, but the quality and some of the features need to be fixed! Why fix something that isn't broken, snapchat?

All of the articles are either extremely biased in their political views, or obsessing over outer appearances and sex. Snapchat, why did you start to post adult/mature content? It says the app is for those ages 12+, but as a 19 yr old female, I don't even want to see the type of stuff Snapchat promotes. Young, easily influenced kids are viewing these inappropriate pictures and content. Snapchat is promoting overly-skinny-naked celebs. I am very confused as to why they would expose their users to such innapropriate content, especially when a majority of their users are under 18. Snapchat needs to rethink the Featured section. The articles are pointless and the cover photos are demeaning to women. At least allow the users to block the articles and featured section."

Only the people you follow can see your story and text you. You can block anybody in general or from seeing you story. Every time you send a snap it goes away, but sometimes when you text you can save it but you don't have to, if you don't it'll go away. I think that this app would be for any kids ages 10 and up!"

I can send and receive messages no problem but in one particular group chat it shows me that everyone in the group viewed my snaps when not everyone did. Also I had a streak scare about 5 mins ago, after I sent a snap to all the streaks with the hourglass next to their name. The hourglass still remained on my screen which scared me a bit cause they were all deep asleep but it turns out our streaks weren't in danger according to them.

It is unacceptable that some of these stories contain sexual content, as I know individuals who are on Snapchat who are at an age where this content should not be easily accessible to them. Also this app keeps causing my phone to crash. I go to load snapchats from friends and my iPhone will just shut off. Yesterday my iPhone shut off at 95-percent battery level and needed to be plugged in. Please fix this. Also, my Snapchat is not loading when I open it. Snaps are not appearing although I get the notifications that I am receiving snapchats. This app has been consistently going downhill, and now it is the worst it has ever been!!!"

UPSET TO THE POINT OF TEARS SHEDDING I kept logging in and out till slowly my snaps in my memories started to appear.

I love the magazine feature on it but I hate the fact that most of what I see if Kardashians and articles about sex. Please fix it. Either make it possible to personalize it or just be honest and change the age rating for the app. Secondly, why is it that when I shoot something horizontally in multiple snaps in a row I look back and the app decides to go back and forth on which way to face??? Instead of just posting it in the direction I shot it at it will rotate the other at random which no reason behind it. Unless it has something to do with how or which way I am holding my phone please fix it. Lastly, why does the app keep turning off my phone at random and sometimes even when my phone is over 50%? Do you know how embarrassing it is to explain to people why my phone turned off for no apparent reason but the app decided so?  \n\nAll in all, come on snapchat. Y'all know better. You've got great feature that you're still discovering but these bugs everyone keeps having hinders on that experience."

The only way is to create a new account but who wants to do that? You have to re-add everyone which can be a real pain. And because streaks are really popular right now, many people don't want to create a new account. I know there's not a way to do it now because of security concerns but maybe there's a way to make it more secure? Maybe require a password or only be able to do it on the website so you have to log in first? That's what I think"

And yes, you can put it on \"Ghost Mode\" and allow people to not see you, but there are other things you should worry about. Just because people cannot see you, doesn't mean you can't see them. So for example, if person A is on ghost mode and is looking at person B, they could potentially plan to do something dangerous or illegal. I suggest Snapchat changes this feature to either not be so accurate and not have street names unless they're main streets."

The percentage could either be viewed by everyone, or the user could have the option to be the only one who sees the voting turnout. Imagine how much easier it will be to communicate an answer, if the person asking does not see who you are...or the person asking can pay a certain amount to \"discover\" the voters (just an idea).. but anyways, hope to hear from you, or see if you act upon this. \nMy snap is: samn07."

Also it freezes up so much it's just annoying to fight with. My whole phone won't work for 20 seconds--I can't even hard-close the app because my screen is just stuck. Also there are times I press record and the red line will start moving to indicate that it's recording, but it will suddenly stop recording mid-snap. Finally when it's not freezing/being slow or cancelling my recordings... it's just flat out crashing! The whole app will just suddenly close.

Recently, I have looked at my friends stories and Snapchat has been putting unwanted ads on their stories and that is just not right. I never got Snapchat to see ads. If I wanted to watched ads or commercials I would watch live tv or find some other source. The other issue I have with this app is the Discover section. It does not make my day when I go to look at my friends' stories and then hit the discover area that has naked stories about Kylie Jenner and many others. Like I said before if I wanted to read those stories, I would not be using Snapchat for that purpose. I am a recent college graduate with a degree in English and a majority of these news stories are not accurate and are not meant to be seen by children especially 12-17 year olds. I used to love Snapchat because I was able to show my friends what I was doing throughout the day easier than texting them but now it is not as great as it once was."

Every time this app gets an update you would expect them to fix these bugs but they instead seem to neglect the obvious flaws in their app. Instead of adding new features and filters fix the ones you already have out and your whole app in general. It's sad to see such a great idea be so poorly executed and yet so popular. If you don't fix these bugs soon, people will begin leave.

People will have the hourglass next to their name even if we snapped just hours before, yet they'll still permanently break if left alone. This is frustrating and confusing because I can't tell when it's a glitch or whether the streak really did break. This week alone I've lost 3 streaks (one of them being near 475 days!). I've deleted the app and reinstalled it but that only solves the problem for a day or two. This is very frustrating and is happening to other friends of mine as well. I love snapchat but this issue is making it less and less enjoyable. Please fix! :("

The updates we've received on snapchat have done nothing but improved the app so far, but what if there could be an update in which you allowed all of your streaks to be in one place. Just like how it shows who your best friends/ recents are. It'll just show who you have streaks with; personally I have about 25+ streaks (not that many) and it's confusing trying to maintain them and having to scroll all the way through my snapchat contacts trying to find all of them. Even though they do have the days you've had the streak next to them, it's still time consuming to go through everyone. Maybe there could just be a \"send to all streaks\" selection or something of the sort. Just anything to make keeping streaks simpler. Thanks!"

My biggest issue is that snapchat tends to crash my phone‚Äîas if I'm holding down the power button and resetting it. Secondly, the app is VERY slow and can lag terribly. Third, the social stories are WAY too innapropriate. 90% of the social things are pornographic and/or overly sexualized. You could at least put the innapropriate ones in their own sections... or put a \"18+\" warning. You guys also Desperately need a option where you don't have to hold down to record. You guys also need an option to crop the video. One last thing, maybe add a little bar or something to zoom in because it's kind of a pain to drag or finger(s). Ok I'm done ranting."

It is a representation of how greedy you guys are, along with the ads you spam in between stories now. Also, you guys are fully aware many young people use Snapchat, and it is not acceptable that you high light and target Trump in each of your discover stories. CNN, the Washington Post, Buzzfeed, and basically all of them at some point have ripped on Trump. You are part of the problem, as these stories get the naive youth all riled up and wanting to \"seek justice\", most of which, is completely false and unnecessary. You are an entertainment app. Quit being a political app. You're annoying all of your users with your petty attempts to spread fake news."

        "content": "Hi, this is probably a wicked petty issue I have with the update, but it really irks me: \n\nI updated Snapchat to the latest iOS version (10.9.0.0, now 10.9.1.0), and my Snapcode gif was overridden by my Bitmoji. Is there really no way to turn choose my gif over the Bitmoji? I deactivated Bitmoji, but it appears to have deleted my Snapcode selfie gif which I've been using since I first downloaded Snapchat, which is a bummer. \n\nAlso some other feedback: I like Bitmoji, but I'm not a huge fan on it appearing everywhere instead of my Snapcode selfie gif. As fun as Bitmoji is and the awesome features it provides, I'd rather have the image I choose represent my Snapchat rather than the Bitmoji's face (As seen on the iOS widget, Quick Chat Search, and now Snapcode, etc). It would be awesome to have a toggle in the Bitmoji menu which allows the display of either Bitmoji or Snapcode selfie on these fronts. After this Snapcode change, I probably won't be activating Bitmoji within Snapchat until something like this is implemented.\n\nThank you"

I know, \"just stop using it\" they say. however, I can't bring myself to leave an app that has brought be so much closer to what is going on around me. snapchat now has become way, way too much. your addition of \"Discover\" was a terrible idea and should have been abandoned after you realized no one was using it. so why bring it to the forefront of users attention? you should have done away with it from the start. the garbage content curated for the youth of this world of which is located within discover stories is bringing the way we see what is going on in the world around us to a new low. you out national geographic at the very end of the selection, when you could have put Daily Mail in its place; a much more fitting location for such garbage entertainment. snapchat is sadly no longer the simple application of which it used to be in its hay day. it is now emulating 12 different apps.

        "content": "Snapchat is by far my favorite and most used app. I can't imagine my life without it. On the other hand, I CAN imagine my life with a redesigned improved Snapchat. Snapchat needs to make more changes to make it more user friendly and less glitchy. \n\n1. Don't open my snapchats. Snapchat automatically opens snapchats sometimes and it bugs me. If I am purposely trying to wait to open someone's Snapchat it will open it anyways and the person will see that I left them on read when I reality I didn't see it at all. \n\n2. Streaks. Streaks needs so many improvements. For example, I lost an 800+ day streak because of Snapchat glitching . I send my streaks 3+ times a day and I still lost it. Another glitch is that not all my streaks send. This makes me have to send streaks more than I should've had to and people get annoyed with it including me. THERE SHOULD BE A BUTTON THAT SAYS STREAKS (kind of like a button that says \"my story\") AND IT AUTOMATICALLY SENDS TO ALL YOUR STREAKS!!! \n\n3. You should be able to send videos without holding the button. For example if I had to show a friend a video of me dancing I wouldn't be able to do it with me holding the button but I could if there was a setting for it.\n\n4. A swipe to delete button will also be really helpful instead of having to go into settings which takes much longer and is a hassle. I usually have to delete chats because they don't load due to snapchats glitches so if you load chats i wouldn't have to delete chats at all. \n\n5. Lastly, Snapchat needs to load faster and make it easier to open and respond to snapchats in a faster way. \n\nPlease make these improvements they will make everyone happier and love Snapchat even more than they already do."

NOT TO MENTION THE ANNOYANCE OF MEMORIES! Constantly flipping open, demanding I add and save stuff into it, and demanding that I upload my photos back into snapchat! Last time I checked snaps died, they went away and vanished... not sat in the app. If I want to save it then let me, no questions asked, no hassle. Snapchat is derailing itself from its original concept, one that clearly worked, SELF DESTROYING COMMUNICATION. Please go back to it, I'm a hairs length and a bad upgrade from giving up."

This is fantastic and if is really as a direct response to your customer's complaints I applaud you wholeheartedly. The only question remains for me is: will hiding these stories make them not visible on my main stories page permanently, or is this only today and I'll have to repeat the same process tomorrow? I hope this option is permanent because I don't think there is a point if the I have to view some inappropriate content every day anyway to hide it, I think the point is I should choose what publishers I deem inappropriate.

Also wishing that we could personalize what we wanted to see on the discover/newsfeed most times it's things on the front covers of half naked girls, inappropriate words and celebrity drama I definitely don't want to see any of those things. Another issue is that you can have a snapchat \"conversation\" with someone with pictures and then you lose your streak later that day without any warning. One last suggestion for me personally i wish there was a notification/banner to tell you when you are about to lose your streaks because the hourglass emoji isn't really working.

Well, for us people who have streaks, we have to continue to scroll and find the names so we can send them our streak pic. I was thinking that maybe you guys can create another option near the \" My story\" and \" Our story\" and have it say         \" Streaks\". Now why would this be beneficial? Well we wouldn't have to take all that time scrolling and searching for our streaks, and now all you have to do is click the \" streaks\" bubble on the top and it will automatically mark all of your streaks. Then all you have to do is click send. In my opinion, this is a much easier and more tactful way to send our streaks. Thank you for your time!"

But the percentage is slim. If I wanted to ONLY see opinions from a liberal position on certain subjects, I will seek them out. If I ONLY wanted to see the Kardashian‚Äôs and what color of hair they have today, I will seek it out.\nIf you must give media and information, do so! Reach out to the teenagers and the 20-something year olds that don‚Äôt yearn for knowledge. But do it with an unbiased agenda. So that young people can mold their own minds and form their own opinions. In my opinion, this is just another way for the world to spread its propaganda, and it‚Äôs sickening."

After I finished crying I thought you myself \"I can't believe technology has this much power and effect on my life\". But anyways I think it would be a GREAT idea if you when you got a streak it would stay the SAME amount of days until you snapchat them but you can never loose your streaks unless you block/unfriend that person. It would make snapchat a lot less stressful because if you loose streaks people get really mad at you. This is sad but technically has finally taken over our lives. At least make technology less bad and just do that one simple request. Thank you!"

Another suggestion is I think there should be a public page where you join public groups to make finding friends easier kinda like my story but like a public option and we can joking and post on which ever one we want and there should be restrictions the person who added it to public for anyone not just their friends to join but public.

I wish they were back at the top like they used to be. There was no reason to move them. One example is that I can't take selfies now without feeling super self conscious because the icons are on my face so I can't even tell what I look like. I know I'm not the only one with this problem. Many of us have to tilt our phones a certain way to feel like we look good in a picture. Who takes a selfie with their face at the top of the screen? Nobody I know. Who takes them tilted so their face is off to the side? Plenty of people. I've tried dealing with not knowing how my eye looks before I post to a story but I'd rather not chance it. I put off reviewing but I couldn't any longer. The rest of snapchat is fine but not this part. Snapchat probably won't ever change back but there's an honest opinion. I believe they should."

Do the makers of this app not understand that many children have this app and are regularly exposed to content that even I, an 18 year old wish to not see?! This may come as a surprise to these lowlife primitives, but not everything in life is about sex. Sex isn't something to be thrown around everywhere like it's having a sandwich with a friend at a restaurant, rather it's something a husband and wife are to share between each other. I don't care about celebrity sex lives or anyone else's, and especially don't want you freaks involved in mine. On top of that, I'm also sick of all the left wing cancerous bias thrown across all the discover snap stories as well. Snapchat does not only prioritize money over its customers, but it also prioritizes it's sick agenda over it's customers."

I mostly use it to share things that are not quite interesting enough for instagram, but still worth sharing with a few people. Which happens a lot!\n\n My only issue with the app is the discover \"newsfeed\" that shows up at the bottom of my unseen stories. This honestly wouldn't be a problem if I could customize what I see there. But the problem is the stupid raunchy photos of celebrity \"nipslips\" and sex advice that is always showing up across there. If I could choose to remove/block certain news outlets (dailymail cosmo etc) I would give this app a 5 star. But because I can't customize the one part of the app that I spend the most time in, I think that the company is prioritizing money over the users. And that merits a bad review in my opinion! \n\nOverall I like the discover newsfeed! It was great for the election news and current things going on. I just don't want to see certain outlets but there is no way to block them. I hope my review helps Snapchat make their app more user friendly!"

Stop. \n\n2. New story line feature swipe.... Ehhhh I think I personally dislike the \"tap left or right\" feature for stories. Good idea. It seems a bit annoying right now. Not as user friendly and too touchy. \n\n3. Please stop with the overly pro gay, gender equality, race equality, feminine equality, EVERYTHING equality bs news posts. \n\nThe news feed used to be fun. Now it's too much like the E news network. Too much Kardashian and Hadids. Too tacky. Is this what people like ? Lame. Laying off of snap for a while because it's becoming annoying like FB did when they stuffed news in your face + \"trending\" stories and became less fun\n\n*is it just me or is snapchat discover/news becoming more inappropriate, sloppy, and obnoxious daily?! Ewe\n\nAfter new update it's not recording sound"

Frankly, I don't want my 12 year old daughter, who uses the app daily, to see that. I am willing to accept that maybe the app is intended to be used by more mature people, but if that's the case, then it needs to be advertised as that and say 16+ or 18+ on the App Store. Please Snapchat Team, allow us to have a way to filter mature content. Because I don't want to see it either."

Anyone interested enough in the news is more likely to use the Internet or frankly, any other source. So with that, I say keep innovating the snap part of Snapchat. It's great and super fun but Discovery is, from what I have observed, pointless. Dedicate your time and resources to refining what snapchat users truly admire about your app, the snapping! As always, keep up the great work. (And stop white washing your promotions üòÅüôèüëç) let's not promote the flawed beauty standard, especially to us naive youth. Happy snapping."

Instead, Snapchat seems to have decided to find every single insignificant gimmick that they can adding them in, in spite of the general discontent of their users. This latest update unveiled a map that allows you to find and pinpoint the exact location of all of your Snapchat friends. This provides a huge opportunity for people to be taken advantage of and for their safety to be compromised.

I never watch them, but I'm forced to load them and use my data just to skip through quickly because I don't like having my notification number sitting there all day (I'm sure everyone can relate to that little red number). I'm aware I can turn off my notifications; but as I said, I love Snapchat and use it often with my normal friends who aren't on some mission to crash their car every day so I keep my notifications on for them. I would love to see an option to delete the snap without having to view it. And also if we could better customize our notifications, so that we could turn off notifications from individual users. \n\nThanks!"

I also can't hide the live stories and there should be an option to do that. Ideally the whole section should be moved COMPLETELY off the stories page and onto a section of its own. Please fix this"

Next... for our Snapchat lenses you should find more ideas other than animal ears and glasses it's getting old bring back some of the first ones. Lastly give us a category where we put people we are having streaks with so you can have a send all button just for the streaks so we don't have to go through and individually click every streak. I'm sure a forced streak was never the intention rather than one that pops up because real conversations but that's what it's come to so please give us a category and another thing with streaks, we should be able to have streaks with a group chat as long as every person in the chat snaps each day if one person fails to snap the streak is lost. Also please give us the option to get a notification when a certain person opens are Snapchat some people are waiting on that.

Like I even restarted my phone; my story, others' stories, my saved snaps; no audio would play and it'd be a still image of the beginning of the video, so those would cycle through the stories rather than videos. Very frustrating.\n\nWith ALL of these glitches and errors, the only solution I have found to work (most of the time) is deleting the app and reinstalling it. This is a pain in the rear, but because of the functionality 80% of the time, I continue to do so.

Now the pictures I took from my original snapcodes are gone, without warning (which I mentioned on my last review). I doubt you guys care much anyway.\n\nPrevious review:\n\nHere's a tip: Give people points for posting up stories.. many of us use that way more often than Direct Snaps.\n\nI created a Bitmoji and then my original pictures that used to be my avatar disappeared. Not only that but the option to use selfies as my avatar is gone? Shoulda warned us that option was removed or else I never would have used to piece of crap Bitmoji.\n\nThis app has gone way downhill. Someone needs to make a better version of Snapchat, like an alternate app."

I hate this new update it's so confusing. At first I gave y'all a 1, then a 2, now y'all back at a 1 again... great job (NOT) and this is awful for left handed users. I hold my phone in my LEFT HAND, and I tap with my LEFT HAND, so the fact that touching with my left hand makes me look at previous snaps is REALLY annoying! I hate this update it's bad & it's awful towards left handed people. Also I hate that people who aren't my friends can view my things like how my followers can share it with other unknown people. I feel that it's really weird and if y'all gonna do that you might as well update the settings part to where we don't have an option on who views our stories. Because clearly ANYONE can view them!! Update 7/28/17- why are my videos out of order?"

        "content": "This app works because everyone has it. In hindsight it might not be the most impressive messaging system, but it's holding up thousands of user accounts. Here's the basic idea: as long as you have internet access, you can take a picture with your phone and send it to your friends and family who also have Snapchat. If you'd like, there is a a way to accumulate all the photos you've taken throughout the day into one slideshow for all your friends to see; it's called a \"story\". There are buttons you can press which add visual quality to your pictures, these are called \"filters\". Filters can make you a dog. Filters will flourish the environment with bubbles and flowers. These are very prominent features in Snapchat, and are changed daily. If you really want to, you can send text messages through Snapchat as well. One thing worth noting is that there have been past interferences with the photo archives. Meaning, there are people who have gained access to what users are exchanging. It's good to keep that in mind and be diligent about the photos you send to others.  \nI'd call this a 5 star app because it has a huge following. Most of my close friends have a Snapchat account that they'll log into daily. It's great for long-distance communication and photo sharing. There'a a chance your favorite celebrity has an account you can follow too. Snapchat is a staple in social media culture, and probably has several more years on its lifespan. Very much worth the download."

But other than that, snapchat downgraded because you took the ability to see how long a story or snapchat is (the timer) away and also took the bitmojis away and those were one of the best stickers. Also, the loop thing is cool but I don't know when a person puts a loop on their snap or if they did not so, it would be nice if you guys updated that so it would let people know if someone has used a loop or not on their snaps. And don't just think that people'll get over this update or get used to it because you guys didn't really update all that much. Snapchat mainly downgraded. So please make an effort to make some adjustments to this things on snapchat because I know for a fact that I am not the only person who is upset about the upgrade. And I never write bad reviews for snapchat even when I don't really like an update because I know I'll get over it but this is a nono. Please respond thank youu :))"

It's also been showing me timestamps, even though both parties (including me) have sent a snap to each other, literally 5 minutes before. Sometimes when I want to check my snaps, around 40-50 of them disappeared, they aren't in my chat, but they're still friends with me on snapchat. The app also freezes when I try to send \"streaks\" and crashes, although I have an iPhone 6s with good internet, it's been happening quite often, and it's annoying me.  Please fix these problems, I keep on getting nervous and anxious every time I think I lost a streak.

Although this is a nice idea, it does not consider the fact that approximately one in nine users is left-handed and will therefore always tap on the left side of the screen. As a left handed user, this makes it so that I must consciously hold my phone in a different way just to view stories. This is unnecessarily inconvenient because obviously I will always use my dominant hand out of habit. This may seem like an obnoxious complaint, and I apologize for that, but this issue is impeding on the casual nature of snapchat that I enjoy. Could you at least add a setting so that left-handed users can opt to disable the feature?"

Even if just seeing it in the story icon preview. Or maybe that person has just started to annoy you lol Add that ‚Äúmute‚Äù feature and it‚Äôll be a 5* app!"

One last thing is to make a way to choose between Bitmoji and a video for the profile pic. We also need lists so u always see ur faves first pls make this real!\n-Thankx"

You keep trying to add useless elements like a kid adding glitter to a project to make it \"look good\". Stop trying to one-up your previous designs, choose one that you can subtly modify, or stop designing updates. Not only is it disappointing to see a completely different layout every time I log in, but it's completely unneeded. You need to fire whoever came up with this new update, because it's absolutely horrible. Find some new designers, who aren't looking to add sh** to the app for brownie points."

This is very annoying bc if I have a friend ranting, and I can't hear what they said, then that makes me look like a bad friend.

When this happens snapchat will automatically scroll to the top. However, sometimes i have already scrolled back down and try to respond to another message. As a result I either click on the wrong message or just need to scroll all the way down after every snap. When you snapchat any more than 10 people this becomes very inconvenient. Additionally, if I do not open a snap for several hours, but do open other snaps, the snap will appear as read. This is frustrating because I do not know what the person said. Please fix. I love snapchat but this update is horrible."

I had to charge my phone and as soon as my phone turned on üí• it was at 40%. So just to test it out, I recently opened the app trying out the filters üòä while keeping track of my battery percentage and in less than 5 minutes (I kid you not) my battery went from 66% down to 52%. I would say for every 10-15 seconds, 1% of my battery went down. Now I don't know if it's my phone (iPhone 6s+/with the most recent software update) or the app which is updated as well. I've read that if I delete the app and download it again the issue should stop, so that is what I'm doing right now. If it doesn't work I'm still gonna use the app but I'll have to carry a charger with me 24/7."

But when I FaceTime someone the sound is all static it hurts my ears, I can't even see them because it's really pixelated 90% of the time. Worse is when I stay on FaceTime for 5 minutes Snapchat kicks me out the app to my home screen. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!"

If anything Snapchat has Snapkidz for children under the age of 13, just for safety and age restriction, so aside from that it's a great application that has a love for photos with filters, stories, streaks, videos, text messages, face calls, stickers, Bitmojis, and a lot more!  I definitely recommend this application!"

If you would bring back discover bubbles so we don't have to see a bunch of inappropriate content this app would be 100X more better and I would rate it a 5 star app. Please take this into consideration, thank you!"

More than once the opportunity passes to capture the moment and I am left frustrated and disappointed that I didn't just use my regular camera. And second, I HATE the discover feature. Every single time I go to watch my friends stories I am bombarded with pornography from the Cosmopolitan, Daily Mail and other discover channels.

Snapchat needs to be redesigned completely, with a new, cleaner and easier to use interface, more customization, a new profile tab, the ability to tag other users in your snapchats, redesigned search & ability to discover new users based on your friends, and the option to completely turn off discover, or at the least, make it a separate page not intruding your friends stories and your stories.

I can just imagine my little sister on snapchat seeing all these stupid Discover stories about Kylie posing nude for a magazine, or \"12 dirty secrets in bed\" kind of articles are just inappropriate. Discover should either fine tune what they have, or get rid of it period. It's just distracting and most of the time inappropriate."

I HATE THIS. especially since I have many streaks, I want to be able to simply scroll down and reply to all the snaps instead of having it scroll back up every time I send one. Please fix this so I can be scrolling and replying to snaps and not have to find my place again every time a snap gets sent. \n2. I don't know if this happens to anyone else, but my snaps get opened by themselves if I don't open them in 5-6 hours. I understand the point of them is to expire, but it's not fair if they get opened overnight or while I'm in school without me seeing them.\n3. Same as everyone else, go back to swiping/tapping for stories!!! Its so annoying to have to tap in a specific place. Please change that. \nLastly 4. Please give us our privacy back with the stories. I don't want random people seeing my stories without my permission. If I did, I would have my stories on the letting everyone see them setting."

        "content": "So I have been an avid Snapchat user for a couple of years now. I do very much enjoy this app. However, I have recently been having the problem that snapchats keeps deleting my unopened snaps! And before anyone says that \"you kept them for too long and they expired.\" I looked it up on the website and it said that \"... Snapchat servers are designed to automatically delete unopened snaps after 30 days.\" However, I found that my unopened snaps have been deleted within only 8-9 hours so this is pissing me off. So please either help me find a way to recover those unopened snaps, or update and fix this problem. Thank you."

This has been happening literally every day-I open my snapchat and it will say I lost my snapstreak with someone when I know I didn't-then later that day the streak will come back. Also, in my best friends list, some of the people who are my best friends (on snapchat) will glitch out into my recents, while having the best friend emoji still and people in my recents will go where they originally were. It is verrry annoying and I hate it. I have restarted my phone and redone loaded snapchat, and it still does the same thing. Please fix this it is very frustrating.

HOWEVER-I am young and inevitably find the best way to keep up with some friends is through social media.\n\n This is the only social media app I will use, for a few reasons. Before I deleted Facebook, I was constantly checking it and spending way too much time on it... Snapchat COULD be like that, but it doesn't have to be by default. As I've not got it connected with any other app, only the few people with whom I've shared the fact that I even have a Snapchat can consume my time. \n\nEven if I did decide to add a bunch of \"friends\" (aka ppl I don't even really like or know well, like I had done on Facebook) I have a choice of whose \"stories\" I view w/Snapchat. I can send pictures to just the few people with whom I'm very close, so I don't have to painstakingly screen what I post in fear of the wrong person seeing it. That's a big plus. \n\nThe filters are also really fun. I'm not big on taking selfies, but the filters even entice me sometimes. Mostly I just use them on my cat, though. \n\nI end up reading a lot of the articles posted too, by groups like National Geographic. Everything is in such small portions, so I can easily digest it piece by piece in small short sittings, & it makes me a more informed person."

So the app is still on my screen, still saying it's loading, letting me \"delete\" it multiple times.\n\n But I love SnapChat. It's a great app.\n\n This leaves me without SnapChat. I can't promise that this will happen to you, but I want to warn everyone. SnapChat is not working at all. It won't let me reinstall it, either. So right now? No SnapChat for me or a friend of mine, it did the same thing on both of our phones. \n\n So I'm going to continue to write so this is longer. \n\n The app's thumbnail right now is just grey with white in the background. I don't really know how to describe it. \n\n But it will not load at all."

For instance , when I send someone a snap with a caption they will see the caption very blurry . Before I had no issue with this . What's the problem now ? great. Another problem with iPod users . Now snapchat logs you off when it glitches and takes you back to the home screen . Please fix these issues"

They didn't need to know your location at all times, let alone what side of your house you're sitting at!!! Now, this is not the case. Snapmap allows others to see your location at all times and this is unacceptable. The \"ghost mode\" isn't acceptable either because it shows the location at which you enabled this mode. I do not feel safe knowing that my location is on a map for all to see. This is an issue of privacy and internet freedom. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.

It is opt-out, which means many people who update have already shared their location before they get the chance to disable this new \"feature\". Imagine how horrible this is for celebrities, cam girls, or other people who must share their snapchats with the world but don't want their location shown along with it for fear of stalkers. \nAt this point, just disable location services on Snapchat. Sure, it blocks your ability to use filters, but it is the only way to be completely sure Snapchat isn't still tracking you. Plus, if enough people do it, Snapchat will be forced to listen, since it uses filters (and the data that comes with them) to earn some revenue!"

And love how the filters make you look nothing less than F-L-A-W-L-E-S-S üëåüèºüíÉüèªüòÑ\n\nUPDATE: I hate to do this put I have to knock down three stars üôÅ Personally, the headlines or news updates are way too much for me. I do not watch the news, don't watch TV at all because there's way too much negativity on there and now I feel like it's all in my face when I get on Snapchat. I would prefer to have an option to hide them.\n\nAlso, if you are going to keep the headlines then my suggestion would be to consider adding headlines from the GoodNews Network. I love reading their articles because the news they publish is all positive, always puts a smile on my face and gives me hope for this world. And I truly believe we need more of that!\n\nUPDATE 10/11/16: Thanks for moving the headlines or news below the recent updates! \n\nThanks!\n\nUPDATE 12/6/16: Please give an option to remove or hide certain news outlets on the newsfeed section like the dailymail, cosmopolitan, etc. I do not appreciate seeing all these celebrity/gossip stories *gagging* being thrown at my face. A significant number of news stories on there are unnecessary for me to know. I just want to enjoy going on snapchat without feeling anxiety or disgust. Please do something about this. I appreciate that you have added the Dodo on the newsfeed. That and the National Geographic and Travel are the only positive news outlets out of the 27 on there üíÄ I feel my soul gets sucked out when I get on snapchat after I look at that newsfeed section. Add the GoodNews Network. Add other types of news that have nothing to do with politics, crimes, perversion, celebrities, drugs, materialism, etc. Add news or tips or stories that are good for our souls. Yoga, meditation, exercise, prayer, inspirational stories, inspirational speakers, like TED talks, Tony Robbins' talks, Deepak Chopra, Oprah, Marie Forleo, Louise Hay, Joel Osteen, etc. Add a \"pay it forward\" news section. A Vegan section. A book section. Something good. Show news that advertise what you want to see more of in the world. We want to see more love, peace, unity, healthy bodies, minds and souls. Right now you are showing a lot of what we do not want in the world. It's like you are advertising what we do not want to see. Greed, violence, materialism, idolatry, perversion, fear, hate, jealousy, unhealthy minds, bodies, and souls. Please just add an option for us to be able to completely remove the news outlets we prefer not to see or read. If you can, just remove it all. That's why we have newspapers and news apps and television to know what's going on in the news. Right now, you all (snapchat) have a great deal of influential power in the world. My little cousins, a 6 year old girl, 10 year old girl, two 12 year old boys, 14 year old boy, and a 17 year old girl, all have snapchat. Please use your great influence to influence us, the world, the best way possible. Please evaluate who you are partnering with and what you allow us to see. Feed our souls not our flesh, if you know what I mean. \n\nThank you\n\nI only say this to you cause I believe in Snapchat. The filters are fun and family friendly. I love people and I'm worried about our world and only want the best for it. Hope you can help make it a better one by putting out more good news not just garbage.\n\nI understand these news outlets or sponsors may be sources of money. But I would definitely pay to have this app if you would remove them all from the app. And I'm sure so many others would as well.\n\nImagine... One version of snapchat without the newsfeed for a certain price. And another version of snapchat with the newsfeed for free. Those who want no newsfeed get to pay in order to support the app. And those who don't care whether they have newsfeed or not get to keep the free version. \n\nI think that would work üòå"

My phone crashed at least 10 times yesterday because I opened Snapchat. It doesn't happen every time I open the app but it's annoying, and I know it's not apple because I already talked to one of there customer service reps and she gave me tips on what to do and none of them worked. So if snapchat could please fix this that would be great! I have an iPhone 6 if Snapchat is wondering."

I went back and tried to screenshot again. The same thing happened. I just ignored it. But EVERY thing on snapchat I tried to screenshot it doesn't work, such as stories celebrities or friends/family, convos, the stories that are from like buzzfeed and dailymail etc, the live stories, and my OWN pictures that are ready to edit, stored in memories, and that are on my story. I really tried to ignore this but I can't, it's aggravating me so much. What if I need to screenshot something very important on snapchat, but i can't cause it comes out super blurry. I asked my friends if they have the same problem and they said no? I read reviews and no one had it, and i googled it, and nothing popped up. Please help me, if you fix this issue I will change this review to a positive one. Thanks for reading."

There needs to be one universal place where you can access all parts of the app. The real kicker was when I even saw that they used the shutter/take picture circle icon for navigation. That icon is synonymous with taking a picture, not exiting a exit or back button. What a joke!!"

Seems nonsensical to make the feature the brings up the filters is the same way to focus. It's impossible to focus because when you tap on the screen it automatically brings up the filters and takes so long to do so the picture is already gone. So many things could make this better.

Although the app is for 17+, it should not post porn for the world to see, and they should at least have an option to turn it off. \n\nSnapchat needs to have more family-friendly content if they want to stay in business.\n\nHonestly, is this how the world has become?

        "content": "Don't get me wrong, I really like Snapchat. I use it all the time! However, there are some REALLY terrible parts to Snapchat that made me give it only 2 stars.\n\nFirst of all, Snapchat ALWAYS crashes. If you open too many Snapchats at once and answer too quickly, the app just crashes. This is unbelievably annoying because when I reopen Snapchat, it says that I didn't open the snapchats I JUST tried to reply to before it crashed. For example, if I open 20 Snapchats and reply to 5 before it crashes and reopen the app, it will still say I have 20 unopened Snapchats. This needs to be fixed.\n\nSecond, Snapchat seems to have a difficult time with the emojis that show who you have a streak with, who is your best friend, etc. My friend and I on Snapchat were best friends with each other for 4 weeks, but he went on vacation and we were not best friends anymore on Snapchat. However, we STILL have the yellow heart emoji that says I am his best friend and he has been mine for 2 weeks in a row, but he is currently my #5. A new person also came on my best friends list, but the emoji that represents that still does not show up. This also needs to be fixed.\n\nThird, when Snapchat crashes, it says that I have new stories to view, but they're stories that I viewed 8 hours ago. \n\nSnap Maps is also a huge problem. Not to mention it's creepy as hell, but it also freezes Snapchat ALL THE TIME. Whenever you try to open snap maps, the app will freeze on you, and you end up having to completely quit out of the app and tap on it numerous times before you can get back in. Get rid of Snap Maps. Zero purpose for it honestly."

At least there is one cool feature, where you can point your camera at somebody's ghost to add them. I mean that's great for when you rarely add people near you I guess.

Also, how are we supposed to know when something is on limitless when you took away the feature that told you how much time was left in the story. How am I supposed to know if someone's story is 5 snaps long or 50 snaps long... I seriously don't have time or patience to finish a story that may be 100 snaps long. Please fix this! Bring back the circle that told you how much time was left in a story and remove the limitless feature off videos, it's pointless and makes stories annoying."

        "content": "I have so many problems with this app, bear with me and at least read this entire review before you judge it.\nPros:\n-Easy to add friends\nCons:\n-Messages disappear when you close the app\n-Images disappear when you look at them twice \n-You get too many notifications (when people start typing, when people look at your picture,)\n-No group chats\n-No privacy (people know when you've read a message, when your on the conversation, when you have seen their picture, etc.)\n-When you are notified that someone sent a message, it doesn't tell you what the message is until you open the app.\n\nI know lots of my cons are why people like the app, but let me explain. So your friend sends you a message, you open it up and look at it and you might not respond right away. Maybe you're busy and you can't type, or your hands are full, or you don't have a response at the moment which is very likely. You close the app and finish what you're doing, and open it back up. The message isn't there anymore, and now you don't even remember what the question even was. Another example of when this is a horrible idea is if you need to look at something your friend sent you earlier to confirm details or something, and now you're out of luck because it's gone. I have the same problem with the picture/video, except at least you can see it twice before it disappears. The part where you can't see a message until you open the app bothers me to because there are situations where you want to see the message before the other person knows that you are there and read it (don't pretend it's never been like that with you). Anyways, I feel like these are problems that would bother people, because they certainly bother me. The reason my review is 2 stars and not 1 is because the app is fully functional, and I haven't encountered any bugs with it yet.\n\nEDIT: I've only had this for a week and I've already been hacked and seen someone else get hacked. I don't know what my friend did, but I didn't click anything that could have easily made me vulnerable. Anyways, i'm lowering my rating to 1 star for the awful security."

However, on my stories list, ALMOST ALL of my friends' stories are being deleted in 1 hour (sometimes 2 or 3) and are not accessible to me by any means. There are usually about 25 friends who do post to their stories on a regular basis and there is no way all of them decided to delete their stories at the same time. PLEASE FIX THIS AND I'LL GIVE BACK 2 STARS!!\n2) Many people have addressed this already but about this Snap Map feature: I have my Bitmoji on Ghost mode anyway but the location tracker of my friends are surprisingly very accurate, which does raise my levels of safety for everyone. Because of this, many parents are scared of letting their teens have Snapchat, and I understand their concerns. Please either delete this feature altogether or make the app be able to disable the access this feature entirely for individual accounts. Thank you!\n3) A little extra but quality? When you add text/emojis/filters to snaps the quality of the entire snap diminishes by like 75%, and it's been worsened in these last couple updates. Would be helpful if that's fixed thanks so much! (I have an iPhone 6 with iOS 10.3 if that helps)\n4) Idk if this issue is with everyone but often whenever I use Snapchat while on data (and often on wifi) my phone (iPhone 6) either randomly restarts or just dies at any battery percentage below 35% while in the app (more often the latter and plugging into a power source does fix the issue but it is still very annoying). Please please please fix/improve the battery management of this app if that is at all possible, I will be very blessed.\n5) Finally, some very minor suggestions. A 'send to all streaks\" option would be extremely helpful to many of us. Also, CAN YOU MAKE A NOTIFICATION THAT ALERTS USERS WITH STREAKS IF THEIR STREAKS ARE ON THE LINE? (‚ùóÔ∏è‚è≥‚åõÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è) Many \"heart attacks\" would be saved...\nLast thing, please try to improve the speed at which switching filters happens. It is currently a bit laggier than it has been earlier...\nThank you if you actually read and listened to our concerns!! üôèüèºüôèüèº Would give back a five star rating if all this is fixed!"

I miss the snapchat from 4 years ago simple and fun, too much clutter now when you try to watch people's stories the huge boxes of stories of random people that I don't watch (no one does) take up more than half the screen seriously cut the crap and go back to 2014 snapchat that's when it was simple fun  and worth 5 stars. There needs to be a way to hide the \"our stories\" from the stories page like you can with featured stories. All of the NFL and prom stories are annoying especially for people who don't want to watch them and can't get rid of them."

I have been wanting to delete my account for a while and the sexual topics on the news outlets combined with this glitch finally pushed me to follow through. I thought it was my phone but that is impossible because my phone is still brand new. I will not be returning back to this app due to the inappropriate and raunchy news articles and the glitches that are just annoying. Thank you for the years of funny snaps with friends. I look forward to the extra time I will have from not being on snapchat."

I have to go into memories and save from there to get the filter back (which is really time consuming and unnecessary.)\nAlso with the latest update, videos no longer play. They are only a still image. This happens with videos sent to me and also on stories.\nLastly, why can we no longer tap through stories automatically? It was so much easier to view them and if you just wanted to skip a story all you had to do was swipe. Selecting the stories I want to view is inconvenient.\nI love Snapchat, but these updates are breaking it."

What is a problem, and has been for about a year now for me, is the fact that when I am snapping and using flash, my screen after flashing, stays on the brightest setting. And only is adjustable after I completely close the app. So each time I snap someone, I have to close the app and shut the app down just to lower the brightness. It's a terrible bug, and I'd make this a solid 5 stars if that could PLEASE be fixed! Thank you so much in advance!!"

Trying to normalize sexuality in the sense of sleeping around is expected and okay, going beyond just sex ed (which a camera app is a strange place to offer sex ed in the first place) to teach things that \"should\" be normalized. I have seen a vast number of posts promoting promiscuity while seeing zero that promote morality, there is clearly a shameful agenda."

I fill pity for the CEO's mind and would recommend the companies employees to find a company which dosent differentiates. And guess what on top ur ipo/stock is dooming from the day it was launched.

I keep having to adjust the volume up and down constantly when I could just flip the switch like I do to begin listening in the first place. Also, you should bring all the \"news\" stories back to the top. It looked so much better to have the blocks above your friends stories to keep it separated from your own story, and then the set of \"old\" stories would be separated by the \"old news\" at the bottom. It just looks too scrunched together now."

I'm not sure why this is the case because it makes it so that I cant check my snapchats unless I have a charger near me or if I'm willing to give up 10% of my battery life just for snapchat.

Every single time I try to upload a picture from my camera roll it turns the picture sideways."

Snapchat is a great place to send any type of message, from photos to videos to messages and more. I love using Bitmoji, Stickers, GeoFilters, GeoTags, and Lenses. They all make the experience of sharing so much better. It's pretty cool that you can make your own GeoFilters and Tags as well. The introductions of sending camera roll photos, voice calling, voice messages, video calling, and group chats was amazing. Also, Snapchat's glasses called Spectacles are so fun to record with and watching the videos are unreal. All in all, I love the new look of Snapchat, it resembles iOS 10 very well."
